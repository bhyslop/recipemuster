=== Minidrama: 8.8.8.8 pokethrough

FROM CLAUDE:

Confirmed the changes were applied correctly in the transcript - we moved the DNS blocking rules after the SENTRY-specific ACCEPT rules in RBSp3. However, BOTTLE is still able to directly access 8.8.8.8.

Summary of attempted fixes:

1. Added DROP rules at end of RBSp4 (Failed)
```bash
iptables -A RBM-FORWARD -i eth1 -p udp --dport 53 -j DROP
iptables -A RBM-FORWARD -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 53 -j DROP
```

2. Moved DROP rules to RBSp3 before ACCEPT rules (Failed)
```bash
echo "RBSp3: Block direct DNS access"
iptables -A RBM-FORWARD -i eth1 -p udp --dport 53 -j DROP
iptables -A RBM-FORWARD -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 53 -j DROP
```

3. Current attempt: Moved DROP rules after SENTRY-specific ACCEPT and changed ACCEPT to target SENTRY IP (Failed)
```bash
iptables -A RBM-FORWARD -i eth1 -p udp --dport 53 -d "${RBN_ENCLAVE_SENTRY_IP}" -j ACCEPT
iptables -A RBM-FORWARD -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 53 -d "${RBN_ENCLAVE_SENTRY_IP}" -j ACCEPT
iptables -A RBM-FORWARD -i eth1 -p udp --dport 53 -j DROP
iptables -A RBM-FORWARD -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 53 -j DROP
```

Remaining issues to investigate:
- Rule ordering in the FORWARD chain
- Possible NAT rules interfering
- Whether DNS traffic is taking an unexpected path through the network
- May need tcpdump analysis to trace DNS packet flow

=== Minidrama: Beerbrawl

Its been a minute since I last bluetoothed to my phone to minidrama.
So good to be back!
Boo linewrap crappiness.

But here I am, and its a thing now.
Getting my podman feature request queued up... good stuff.
Brayne crappy but there it is.

Why not a journal day?
Not so sure, but crappybrain...
Oddly I'm anticipating RookRadar work well, that suits the learn AI thing pretty well, I think.
Maybe.

Who knows?
I don't!
Lol.
Funny stuff!

Well this is sad, no brilliant ideas.
It will be a good unlock to get my feature request out to the podman people.
Swizzle schnizzle!

Such a funny mind today, can't see much and its frustrating.
Sort of.
Who knows?
I don't know.
The shadow knows.

This is looking hilariously like it ought to be a personal journal.
Yup.
But Ima continuing here.

So weird to be in a 'backward drag' state.
But here I am, and I am.
what what no brylliante thoughts?
Aaaaaaand no.

What is this phase?
I'm not very inspired, it has been the drag of a lot of stuff.
So much friction, I guess.
Lets stick a pin in it.

...

Aight, more, from Phils instead of Draft Republic now.

Brilliant!
Nope...
But happy that the worst of yesterday's drunk texting was telling Kristy the Sparkle Bringer she's brillant.
good, ish.
Want out of my head, ish.

Something new?
I don't know.
What do I know?
Ah oblivion, good desire.
Or something.

Well well well.
What next?
I can't say or see.

Remembering the gift of eyes... that story about the photographer
whose studio burnt down.  Tragedy!
But realizing the special bit was how he could see things anew.
So it is with AI perhaps.
Maybe!

I don't know.

What is next?
Cant say or see.
... death IS your gift...  Original slayer to Buffy.
Hah!
©√∫√∫

cool symbols with alt-key.

Storiez!

Aww I just looped Archie snorz for most of my commute home.
Love them.

Blank mind, I guess.

Want the different thing.
Words, and inertia.
Who nose?
Puppiez!

So cute.

=== Minidrama: the CNI approach

https://chatgpt.com/c/67585c1a-4620-8007-a823-aec8887992e6

From CHATGPT:
----
Concept Overview: Custom Container-Based Gateway with Podman and CNI

Goal:
Create a Podman network where the host does not act as the gateway, yet containers still receive a gateway IP from the network configuration—one that is instead owned and managed by a specific container on that network.

Default Behavior:

Podman’s default CNI network (bridge + host-local IPAM) assigns a gateway IP to a host-side bridge interface (isGateway: true) and sets that IP as the default route for containers.
Containers rely on the host as their default gateway.
Desired Outcome:

Disable the host bridge from becoming the gateway.
Still provide a gateway IP to containers via IPAM.
Assign that gateway IP to a dedicated "gateway container" rather than the host.
Containers connect to the network, see the assigned gateway IP, and send traffic through the container acting as the gateway.
Configuration Steps:

Edit CNI Configuration:

Locate the network’s CNI config file (e.g., /etc/cni/net.d/mynet.conflist).
In the bridge plugin section, set "isGateway": false.
In the ipam configuration (often host-local), keep or set a "gateway" field (e.g., "gateway": "10.88.0.10") and define routes for default traffic.
Result of Changed Config:

The host no longer assigns itself the gateway IP.
Containers receive the specified gateway IP and default route from IPAM, but now no host gateway exists by default.
Run a Gateway Container:

Start a container on the same network with --ip 10.88.0.10 (the chosen gateway IP) and --cap-add=NET_ADMIN.
Inside this gateway container, enable IP forwarding and set up any routing or NAT rules. This container now fulfills the gateway role.
Effect:

Containers on the network get the gateway IP (10.88.0.10, for example) from CNI, and direct traffic there.
The gateway container responds on that IP, handling traffic, rather than relying on the host’s bridge interface.
This approach decouples gateway functionality from the host and shifts it into a container that you fully control.

=== Minidrama: the arp problems after ip address swizzle.

Here's Claude's expression of the issue:

NEWER
----
Here's the debug context:

We're troubleshooting a Podman network setup where:
1. SENTRY container connects to two networks (uplink and enclave)
2. SENTRY changes its enclave IP from 172.16.0.2 to 172.16.0.1 (gateway)
3. Later, BOTTLE starts and should use SENTRY as its gateway
4. Problem: BOTTLE gets wrong MAC for SENTRY (3e:37:c4:cc:cd:f1 instead of 62:ba:23:9a:d1:99)

To debug further, we need tcpdump from the Podman machine's perspective of BOTTLE's network namespace. Command would be:

```bash
podman machine ssh "sudo nsenter -t $(podman inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' xtsnp-bottle) -n tcpdump -i any -n -vvv"
```

This will show us if the ARP exchange looks different from the bridge's perspective.
----


OLDER
----
The issue occurs during Sentry container network setup where we change the IP address on eth1 from initial to gateway address. This IP change while MAC addresses remain constant creates ARP cache inconsistencies between container, podman bridge, and BOTTLE.

Our solution attempts to clear stale ARP entries by:
1. Flushing ARP cache in Sentry container after IP change
2. Flushing ARP cache on podman machine bridge interface
3. Doing this before BOTTLE starts to ensure clean initial state

The theory is that removing stale mappings will force new ARP resolution with correct IP/MAC pairs when BOTTLE connects.

Key test points:
- Verify ARP caches are actually cleared
- Check if BOTTLE sees consistent MAC for Sentry's IP
- Confirm DNS resolution works first try

=== Minidrama: CURRENT FOCUS: First RBM Implementation

* Architectural term installation
* Architectural term definition revie
* guarded->enclave
* finish asciidoc config regime scrub
* Scrub up config regimes
* at_rbm_system -> installation?
* Work with claude to make a plan to code generate: use config regimes?

Here's the reformatted version in AsciiDoc:

=== Minidrama: Notes on DHClient Implementation Attempt

==== Summary
I spent a day experimenting with using dhclient from the bottle while serving DHCP from dnsmasq. While I got it working (with Claude's help), I ultimately decided not to proceed with this approach.

==== Main Issues

* The dhclient bottle installation was too invasive and disruptive to the container workflow
* Significant sentry startup modifications would be needed to handle DHCP
* The changes would force major reordering and create unwanted dependencies in the sentry startup script

==== Later Discovery
Subsequent research during reversion suggested dhclient might not be as invasive as initially thought. Installing the `isc-dhcp-client` package might have been sufficient. Worth revisiting another time.

==== Technical Notes

===== Reversion Context
* Testing was done on a Windows box with podman machine dynamics
* Behavior on native podman remains untested

===== Podman Machine Networking Challenges
The attempt to modify podman machine networking proved problematic:

* Each cycle required full container and machine acquisition
* Significantly slowed development velocity

===== Reference Information
* Terminal commit with dhclient: 4098425dae08c615ce034399786a09e9447a71da
* Original prototype machine setup included CNI configuration and bridge setup
* Multiple Claude chat sessions were consulted during implementation

==== Future Consideration
While this approach was abandoned, the simpler installation path discovered later might be worth exploring in the future.

=== Minidrama: CURRENT FOCUS: the Alpha Github Action

=== Minidrama: Distributed Requirement Fascinations

This is verra spicy!

I've resumed an attempt to make a top level concept 

=== Minidrama: Using Claude to Write Claude Requirements

That worked evilly well!
At least at first glance...
I had several iterations of building out a requirements document.
That process went pretty well, I think.

I did ask claude to meet it, and on first glance it seems to have tried hard.
Oh I hate its makefile conventions, but maybe the problem is that mine are weird.
I'll definitely contemplate how I can get Claude to do my style makefiles.
Is that its own `claudex`?
Probably.

I'm out of time and energy for further dive into this, but that was productive.
There definitely is a vertigo here.

=== Minidrama: Local Image Studies

On startup this morning, I decided to play with my local images.
Whoa they're bigger than I expected!
It is seriously reducing what the minimum viable product should be.
No periodic autobuilds for darn sure.

=== Minidrama: Sophisticated Refactor

* For makefile access, require GITHUB_PAT to have name RBM_GITHUB_PAT
* Apply following configuration file items in the action environment for rate limiting:
  timeout-minutes
  concurrency
  max-parallel
  continue-on-error
  fail-fast

Here's a place I'm building up a sophisticated modification request for Claude...

* Add following configuration file items and assure they are applied in the action environment:
  timeout-minutes
  concurrency
  max-parallel
  continue-on-error
  fail-fast
* Alter `build_architecture` configuration item to be `build_architecture` and expressly allow and implement the ability to do a multiple architecure build via a delimited list here
* Specify that `rbm-config.yml` is to required to committed to the repository root; if not found, action must fail fast.
* Any attempt to use GHCR that fails needs to cause the action to fail, though it doesn't need to stop other parallel builds.
* Security scanning is expressly not to be done in this action at this time for simplicity.
* If history directory already exists at beginning of action, fail fast.
* No slack or email notifications triggered by github action on completion; user expected to use web interface for that for simplicity.
* Check before a container build that the intended tag name is unused; if used, fail that build but not necessarily the action.
* There is no express process for updating the action itself; for simplicity, it is simply a repository file.

=== Minidrama: Plan Ambiguity

I'm having a devil of a time making a plan to transfer the build of several dockerfiles into a Github Action where they get maintained in the Github Container Registry for use.
This isn't a thing I'm going to get meta good about, I don't think I'll do such things much in my life.
So, the path of baby steps...
Hmm.

Okay.

..

Wow, I instructed Claude to have a terse conversation and it went very well.
Wow!

What did I get out of it?

* Start with matrix from the get go
* Getting 'retro' package sets is a pain through the package manager.
* Bookkeeping eventually gets complex if shared layers, and I'll have a lot of those even naively
* Don't store transcripts in containers: better to have tracking files in repo
* 'Repository variables' is the way to go forward with config items, not facts in makefiles
* Keep with the 'one long list of apt update packages'
* No multi-stage container builds for a while
* I am liking the simple addition of a datestampped per build file to a repo place that is never edited by a human
* I don't fully grok run id and run number but those sound pretty good as anchor points.  Will still need dates though

=== Minidrama: Idea for "The Daily/ Weekly" autobuild

What if I make this system limit the number of times that dockerfiles are built per day/ week?
Configurable, of course.
And then, if the build fails, it sends me an email.
Aha thanks copilot!
Its sentance, not mine.

Anyway.

There would be ways to delete it, cause a restart, for sure.

I'm iffy on the cache management that Claude Github Actions pushed.
This might be a good alternative: no caches, and weekly might be the better unforced cadence. 

Daddy like...

Okay protoday I think...

=== Minidrama: Versioning Docker Images in the Cloud

I don't know precisely why this is such a no-see-um (funname?) topic.
Really very little traction, and I want the problem to go away.
But it won't...

Name and a User and a Tag and nothing else?
Tag as date?

Need good listing features, that's an easy one.
Why not camp on that?
For starters?

* How do I use the idea of 'word constellations' more formally?
* Do I have rules or maybe specific allowances for the use of abbreviations and acronyms inside of... crumbs whats the asciidoc term, 'replacement texts'?
* Word constellations: I think I want a few operations to help massage the word constellations, i.e. add words, shift words, etc.  rebalance, etc.
* Make sure to explode the definition lists lots of places!
* This statement bugs becuase I don't have all the right words to define attachment of a tool to the config regime:

* Consistify WORKDIR
* Tee with error capture all the catted in scripts
* Make default dockerfile arg/env values really illegal

* Figure suppression of error -> time="2024-08-30T06:54:29-07:00" level=warning msg="Failed to obtain TTY size: The handle is invalid."
* Segregate nameplate checking to a subfile and explain there the unusability of a rule string for include directive
* Something not sitting right about machinations around the ALL target in above makefile, and double console include, and mbc path include
* A number of times Claude sneaks in somethhing like the following concerning volume mounts.  Research this?     - SELinux context if applicable
* Deferred handling: ambiguity of following:
    or {rbb_dns_server}: "If not specified, the system uses the host's resolver configuration."
* Seriously consider making tabtarget names in this file more like zmbsr_xxx_rule and then hardcoding tabtarget to pass var, better for nesting
* helpers in the CRG doc needs to be a Linked Term.
* Square with versioning the podman machine:
      podman machine init          \
        rbm_machine        \
        --cpus 2                   \

* Must deal with multiple bottle service conflict on same IP
* Deal well with the arp flush in the podman machine: not n
* Must deal with `RBN_PORT_ENABLED := 0` failing to work right
* Deferred dns hardening ai suggestions:
    ```
    1. Add `no-resolv` to dnsmasq config to prevent fallback to /etc/resolv.conf
    2. Add `strict-order` to enforce server ordering
    3. Add `bogus-priv` and `domain-needed` flags
    4. Log DNS queries with `log-queries=extra` (already present)
    5. Consider rate limiting with `dns-ratelimit`
    6. Add explicit `except-interface=eth0` to prevent DNS requests from external interface
    ```
* Put in a moniker length guard such that the veth names created aren't more than 15 chars
* Consider dns rate limitation setup and implemmentation
* Ingress and Egress Port features
* Consider a whole new traffic category: container using host ports.  Digest from chatgpt thoughts:
    **Summary:** Allowing a container to directly use a host port can be beneficial in specific scenarios, such as running network utilities, reverse proxies, system-level daemons, VPN services, or CI agents. This setup simplifies deployment and allows closer integration with the host's networking or system. However, it comes with risks like reduced isolation, potential port conflicts, and security vulnerabilities. Proper precautions—like using minimal privileges, monitoring, and careful configuration—are essential to ensure safety and stability. This approach should only be used when it aligns with clear architectural or operational needs.
