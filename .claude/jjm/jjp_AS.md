# Paddock: rbw-spec-axla-coherence

## Context

Bring Recipe Bottle specification ecosystem into coherent alignment with AXLA patterns. This heat establishes the structural foundation.

## Downstream Work

**CRITICAL: After completing this heat**, plan a follow-up heat to **refine AXLA regime vocabulary itself** based on what we learn during:
- Expanding axrg_* section
- Creating BURS and BURC specs
- Studying all RB regimes (BUD_, RBRN, RBRR, etc.)

AXLA will need refinement to capture patterns we discover. That work belongs in a future heat (not in ₣AS).
