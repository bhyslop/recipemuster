# Paddock: rbw-rekindle-bottle-focus

## Build Requirements

This heat focuses on RBW (bash/GCP tooling). No Rust builds required — skip `tt/vow-b.Build.sh` and `tt/vow-t.Test.sh` for pre-wrap verification.

## Context

Rekindle the Recipe Bottle infrastructure after a period of dormancy. Verify GCP resources are still active, Docker lifecycle works, and test suites pass.
