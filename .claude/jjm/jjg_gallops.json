We discovered vvi_install.sh vs vvx_emplace distinction during implementation.\n\n- **Template lifecycle** — VOS specified Whisper builder API but not how templates flow from vov_veiled → parcel → target CLAUDE.md.\n\n- **Naming collisions** — \"install\" meant different things at different layers.

Identify lessons for future specification work.\n\n## Two Failure Modes\n\n### 1. Unrecognized Unspecified Complexity\n\nThings that were harder than VOS suggested, or emerged during implementation:\n\n- **Layered architecture** — VOS didn't clearly separate bash orchestration from Rust utilities. We discovered vvi_install.sh vs vvx_emplace distinction during implementation.\n\n- **Template lifecycle** — VOS specified Whisper builder API but not how templates flow from vov_veiled → parcel → target CLAUDE.md.\n\n- **Naming collisions** — \"install\" meant different things at different layers. Required inventing emplace/vacate vocabulary.\n\n- **What else?** — Review implementation paces for \"we had to figure this out\" moments.\n\n### 2. Overspecification Without Quality\n\nVOS prose that didn't translate to better code or clearer thinking:\n\n- **Builder API** — Fluent `.cipher().display_name().register()` pattern specified in detail, but static structs work fine.\n\n- **Runtime Conclave** — \"Collects Whispers\" language implied runtime registration; compile-time const aggregation is simpler.\n\n- **Liturgy depth** — Signet/Epithet/Inscription/Vesture vocabulary: useful for thinking, or just baroque naming?\n\n- **What else?** — Review VOS sections that have no implementation counterpart.\n\n## Review Process\n\n### Phase 1: Implementation Inventory\n\nList what actually exists after ₢AAABM:\n- Rust modules and their responsibilities\n- Bash scripts and their responsibilities  \n- Data files (brand, registry, templates)\n- Key types and functions\n\n### Phase 2: VOS Section Audit\n\nFor each VOS section, classify:\n- **Implemented as specified** — VOS matched reality\n- **Implemented differently** — VOS idea present, form changed\n- **Not implemented** — VOS specified, we skipped it\n- **Implemented but unspecified** — We built it, VOS didn't mention it\n\n### Phase 3: Gap Analysis\n\nFor each gap:\n- Was VOS wrong (overspecified, wrong abstraction)?\n- Was implementation expedient (tech debt, will revisit)?\n- Was this genuinely emergent (couldn't have known)?\n\n### Phase 4: VOS Revision\n\nUpdate VOS to:\n- Remove speculative complexity that didn't earn its keep\n- Add discovered complexity that should be documented\n- Clarify layered architecture (bash vs Rust responsibilities)\n- Simplify Whisper/Conclave to match lite implementation\n\n### Phase 5: Lessons Learned\n\nDocument in paddock steeplechase:\n- What specification patterns worked well\n- What patterns led us astray\n- Recommendations for future heat specifications\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. Gap analysis document (can be in paddock or memo)\n2. Revised VOS reflecting implementation reality\n3. Steeplechase entry with lessons learned\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- ₢AAABM (whisper-conclave-lite) — Implementation complete to compare against\n\n## Not in Scope\n\n- New features\n- Refactoring beyond VOS alignment\n- Other concept model documents (JJD, MCM, etc.)",

Query steeplechase for most recent `s` marker for this heat\n  2. If none found OR timestamp > 1 hour ago: probe needed\n  3. If probe needed:\n     a. Spawn `claude --print --model haiku` → capture model ID\n     b. Spawn `claude --print --model sonnet` → capture model ID  \n     c. Spawn `claude --print --model opus` → capture model ID\n     d. Collect hostname via `hostname` command\n     e. Collect platform via `uname -s` + `uname -m`\n     f. Create `s` marker via internal chalk creation (same transaction)\n  4. Return: probe was performed (true/false)\n- Key: ALL execution happens in Rust. Slash commands just read the output flag.\n\n## Files\n\n1. JJSA-GallopsData.adoc - Add jjdr_session_probe mapping and inline definition\n2. JJSCSD-saddle.adoc - Add Needs-session-probe output (Rust computes and sets this)\n3. JJSCPD-parade.adoc - Add Needs-session-probe output for heat mode\n\n## NOT in scope\n\n- Slash command modifications - they consume the flag, don't execute the probe\n- Separate JJSRSP file - routine is simple enough to define inline in JJSA\n\nAcceptance: jjdr_session_probe is clearly defined as Rust-autonomous following vvcc pattern.
