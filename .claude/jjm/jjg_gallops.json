The S/s distinction (Slate vs Session) is easy to miss. We want a registry pattern that catches collisions.\n\n## Design\n\nCreate a `jjrnm_MarkerRegistry` (marker module) with:\n\n1. **Code constants** — all marker chars defined in one place:\n   ```rust\n   pub const JJRNM_APPROACH: char = 'A';\n   pub const JJRNM_WRAP: char = 'W';\n   pub const JJRNM_SLATE: char = 'S';\n   pub const JJRNM_SESSION: char = 's';\n   // etc.\n   ```\n\n2. **Registration struct** — mini object that registers on construction:\n   ```rust\n   pub struct jjrnm_MarkerCode {\n       code: char,\n       name: &'static str,\n   }\n   \n   impl jjrnm_MarkerCode {\n       pub const fn new(code: char, name: &'static str) -> Self {\n           Self { code, name }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Static registry** — collects all codes, validates uniqueness:\n   ```rust\n   // Using inventory crate or lazy_static with a validation function\n   // Panics at init if any two codes collide\n   ```\n\n4. **Validation** — either:\n   - Runtime: `lazy_static` init that panics on collision\n   - Test: `#[test]` that iterates all markers and checks uniqueness\n   - Compile-time: const fn if feasible (preferred)\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. New file `jjrnm_markers.rs` with constants and registry\n2. Update `jjrn_notch.rs` to use constants from registry\n3. Test that validates no collisions exist\n4.
