This fails in some environments (e.g., work machines) where haiku/sonnet return verbose or unexpected output that doesn't parse as a bare model ID.\n\nChanges:\n1.

Write all raw probe results to a file in BUD_TEMP_DIR (requires threading BUD_TEMP_DIR through to the probe — likely via env var or parameter)\n4.

The concept belongs in VOS/VVC (arcane universe), not JJK (equestrian universe).\n\nDecisions reached:\n- Name: INVITATORY (liturgical: the call that opens the Divine Office)\n- Action letter: :i: (available, not used by any current chalk marker or heat action)\n- Commit prefix: vvb: (not jjb:) — this is VVC's domain\n- Searchable token: INVITATORY appears in commit body for easy git log --grep\n\nOpen questions to resolve:\n1. What triggers the invitatory? Currently only saddle (via mount). Should muster or any first-jjx-command trigger it? Or should it be a standalone vvx command?\n2. Commit format: vvb:HALLMARK:i: INVITATORY YYMMDD-HHMM — no identity field needed since it's heat-independent. But does this break the existing 4-field format convention?\n3. VOS spec voicing: INVITATORY needs to be defined in VOS-VoxObscuraSpec.adoc. What section? What linked terms?\n4. JJSA impact: Remove session marker (s) from JJSA steeplechase protocol, or keep it as a JJK-level alias that delegates to vvb?\n5. Backward compat: Existing :s: session commits in git history — do we care? Probably not, just document the transition.\n\nDeliverable: A written design in the paddock or a memo that resolves all open questions above, ready for implementation in the subsequent pace (₢AWAAL probe-opus-as-interpreter).",

Subdocs like RBSRV should carry real detail, but currently they're thin\ntables restating what the parent already says. Need a pattern where:\n- Parent carries schema (anchors, types, AXLA annotations, terse definitions)\n- Subdoc carries validation topology (groups, conditions, constraints)\n\n## Design Decisions (settled)\n\n1. Parent/subdoc split: parent owns all [[anchors]] and attribute mappings with AXLA\n   annotations. Subdoc owns validation detail structured by bare voicings.\n\n2. No mutex concept needed: add RBRV_VESSEL_MODE enumeration (bind/conjure) to make\n   both RBRV groups conditional. Mutex semantics emerge from single-valued enum.\n\n3. Not every variable needs a group. Groups are for variable subsets with shared\n   activation conditions.\n\n4. Bare voicing metapattern: parent context (axrg_regime, axo_procedure) licenses a\n   specific vocabulary of bare voicings in included subdocs. Linter validates grammar\n   per context type. Already working for procedures (axs_inputs, axs_behavior, etc.).\n\n5. Two-level bare voicing structure for regime subdocs:\n   - Section level: axs_group (marks a variable group)\n   - Within group: axg_conditional (activation condition), axg_required (required vars),\n     axg_optional (optional vars)\n\n## Remaining Design Work (interactive — not bridleable)\n\n1. Prefix conventions for context-licensed bare voicings. Need naming that signals\n   which context a bare voicing belongs to and what nesting is legal. The axg_ prefix\n   is provisional.\n\n2. Exact AXLA term definitions for: axs_group, axg_conditional, axg_required, axg_optional.\n   Consider whether axg_conditional prose must name gate variable + activation value.\n\n3. Whether axd_dependent (variable-level conditionality, e.g. RBRN_UPLINK_ALLOWED_CIDRS\n   depends on ACCESS_ENABLED=1 AND ACCESS_GLOBAL=0) is needed alongside group-level\n   conditionality, or if group-level is sufficient.\n\n4. Document the bare voicing metapattern itself in AXLA — the concept that parent\n   context licenses subdoc grammar.\n\n## Apply Pattern\n\n5. Add RBRV_VESSEL_MODE enumeration to RBAGS vessel regime section.\n\n6. Restructure RBSRV using bare voicing pattern: axs_group sections with\n   axg_conditional/axg_required/axg_optional markers.\n\n7. Validate pattern against RBRN's structures (Entry conditional on ENTRY_ENABLED,\n   Enclave unconditional, Uplink compound conditions).\n\n## Inputs\nRBSRV, RBAGS (lines 1467-1519), RBRN, AXLA-Lexicon.adoc, MCM, CRR\n\n## Output\nUpdated AXLA with regime bare voicing terms, restructured RBSRV as exemplar,\nRBRV_VESSEL_MODE added, clear precedent for future regime subdocs.",

Do RBRN's unconditional groups (Enclave, Core) work with axhrgb_group without axhrgc_gate?\n2. Does the stacked axhrgc_gate pattern (AND semantics) handle RBRN's compound conditions?\n3. Is RBRN_ENTRY_ENABLED already an enumeration, or does it need to become one for gates?\n   Boolean variables as gates: does axhrgc_gate require axt_enumeration or can axt_boolean work?\n4.

The inscription structure definition deliberately omits envelope, deferring to vesture. This pace formalizes what exists.\n\nTASK: Create voslve_envelope linked term and reconcile the definition.\n\nIssues to resolve:\n\n1. Two flavors exist:\n   - Suffix envelope: `.sh`, `.rs`, `.adoc`\n   - Frame envelope: `:...:`, `[[...]]`, `/...`\n   - Are these one concept or two?\n\n2. Validation dependency:\n   - VVX needs envelope to validate inscriptions\n   - Same string (`voslc_cipher`) valid in multiple domains with different envelopes\n\n3. Function invocation ambiguity:\n   - Is `buc_log_args()` an inscription with `()` envelope?\n   - Or is `buc_log_args` the inscription and `()` just invocation syntax?\n\n4. Prefix vs suffix envelopes:\n   - Slash commands: `/` prefix\n   - Git refs: `refs/` prefix  \n   - Extensions: `.sh` suffix\n   - Frames: both sides (`:...:`)\n\n5.

              "text": "Establish AXLA-compliant linked term patterns for state machines and their state values. JJD's pace states serve as the exemplar; pattern should generalize.\n\n## Context\n\nJJD defines pace states (`rough`, `bridled`, `complete`, `abandoned`) with `jjdpe_*` prefix and heat status (`current`, `retired`) with `jjdhe_*` prefix. These voice `axt_enum_value`, which is correct but incomplete:\n\n1. **No machine identity**: The state machine itself has no linked term — only its values do\n2. **Implicit ensign**: The `pe` in `jjdpe_` implicitly means \"pace enum\" but this isn't documented\n3. **No transition semantics**: State machines have allowed transitions; these aren't captured\n4. **AXLA gap**: No motif for \"state machine\" as an entity type distinct from plain enumeration\n\n## Proposed Pattern\n\n**State Machine Entity**\n\nA state machine is an `axo_entity` with:\n- Named identity (linked term with anchor)\n- Enumerated state values (each a linked term referencing the machine)\n- Optional: transition rules, initial state, terminal states\n\n**Naming Convention (using VOS liturgy)**\n\nGiven cipher `jj` and domain `d` (data model):\n- Machine: `jjdsm_{name}` — `sm` is the ensign meaning \"state machine\"\n- Values: `jjd{abbrev}e_{value}` — `{abbrev}` identifies which machine, `e` = enum value\n\nExample for pace lifecycle:\n- Machine: `[[jjdsm_pace_lifecycle]]` — the state machine entity\n- Values: `[[jjdpe_rough]]`, `[[jjdpe_bridled]]`, etc. — reference `jjdsm_pace_lifecycle`\n\n## AXLA Additions\n\nAdd to AXLA:\n\n```asciidoc\n// Axial State Machine Terms\n:axsm_state_machine:          <<axsm_state_machine,State Machine>>\n:axsm_state_machine_s:        <<axsm_state_machine,State Machines>>\n:axsm_state_value:            <<axsm_state_value,State Value>>\n:axsm_state_value_s:          <<axsm_state_value,State Values>>\n:axsm_transition:             <<axsm_transition,Transition>>\n:axsm_transition_s:           <<axsm_transition,Transitions>>\n:axsm_initial:                <<axsm_initial,Initial State>>\n:axsm_terminal:               <<axsm_terminal,Terminal State>>\n:axsm_terminal_s:             <<axsm_terminal,Terminal States>>\n```\n\n## JJD Updates\n\nAdd state machine definitions and update state value definitions to reference their machine. Define machines with transitions diagram.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **Transition triggers**: Should we name the operations that cause transitions (bridle, wrap, etc.) or is referencing the CLI operations sufficient?\n\n2. **Machine nesting**: Heat status affects which pace operations are valid. Document this constraint?\n\n3. **Serialization note**: JSON uses plain strings (`\"rough\"`). Linked terms are documentation-only. Add a note about this?\n\n4. **Category prefix**: Is `axsm_` the right prefix, or should state machines live under existing `axt_` (types) or `axo_` (entities)?\n\n5. **HMK relationship**: How does this relate to HMK (Hard-state Machine Kit) if/when that develops? Should we reserve namespace?\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. AXLA: Add `axsm_*` category (or chosen alternative) for state machine motifs\n2.

VLS becomes their new home but the prefixes document their Vox Obscura family origin.\n\n**BUS creates new bus*_ prefixes:**\n- bust_tabtarget — Tabtarget Vesture (moved from vosldt_)\n- busd_* — Dispatch terms (replacing vosd_*)\n  - busdc_colophon, busdf_frontispiece, busdi_imprint\n  - busdm_formulary, busdl_launcher\n\n## VLS Content (Tools/vok/vov_veiled/VLS-VoxLiturgicalSpec.adoc)\n\nExtract from VOS lines 359-590 (excluding Tabtarget Vesture):\n\n1. **Mapping section** with vosl_* category declarations and attribute references\n2. **Core Liturgy Terms section** — Cipher, Signet, Ensign, Monogram, Epithet, Inscription, Vesture\n3. **Liturgy Domains section** — Rust, Bash, AsciiDoc, Publication, Git, Slash vestures\n4. **Cipher Registry section** (moved from VOS lines 1586-1703) — vofc_registry documentation\n\nAdd new content:\n- Terminal exclusivity rules (from CLAUDE.md \"Prefix Naming Discipline\")\n- Minting workflow guidance\n\n## BUS Content (Tools/buk/vov_veiled/BUS-BashUtilitiesSpec.adoc)\n\nCreate new spec:\n\n1. **Mapping section** with bust_* and busd_* category declarations\n2. **Tabtarget Vesture section** — Construction rules for launcher inscriptions\n3. **Dispatch section** — Colophon, Frontispiece, Imprint, Formulary, Launcher\n4. **Routing Behavior section** — How formularies dispatch, workbench/testbench patterns\n\n## VOS Updates\n\n1. Remove Liturgy section (lines 359-590)\n2. Remove Dispatch section (lines 591-694)  \n3. Remove Cipher Registry section (lines 1586-1703)\n4. Remove vosl_*/vosd_* from mapping section (lines 17-40, 46-82)\n5. Add Overview reference: \"For naming system vocabulary, see VLS. For tabtarget dispatch, see BUS.\"\n6. Replace inline {vosl_*}/{vosd_*} references with prose: \"Cipher (defined in VLS)\", etc.\n\n## CLAUDE.md Updates\n\nAdd to File Acronym Mappings:\n- **VLS** → `vok/vov_veiled/VLS-VoxLiturgicalSpec.adoc`\n- **BUS** → `buk/vov_veiled/BUS-BashUtilitiesSpec.adoc`\n\n## Execution Order\n\n1. Create VLS (largest extraction, establishes pattern)\n2. Create BUS (references VLS for context on what Tabtarget Vesture is)\n3. Update VOS (remove sections, add cross-references)\n4. Update CLAUDE.md (acronym mappings)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- ₢ADAAG (liturgy-dispatch-dispersion-study) ✓ Complete — GREEN LIGHT confirmed\n\n## Bridleability\n\nNOT bridleable — requires design judgment for:\n- Prose wording in new spec documents\n- Cross-reference style between VOS/VLS/BUS\n- MCM compliance decisions for new documents",

These apply to ALL specifications, not just kit distribution. Should be standalone spec that VOS references.\n\n**Dispatch (VOSD)** — Tabtarget vocabulary. Two categories:\n- Naming components: Colophon, Frontispiece, Imprint (parts of tabtarget inscription)\n- Operational concepts: Formulary, Launcher, Workbench, Testbench (routing behavior)\n\nBUK invented tabtargets; BUK should define them completely. Keeping naming + operations together tells the whole tabtarget story in one place.\n\n## Proposed Split\n\n**VLS (Vox Liturgical Specification)** — new file `Tools/vok/vov_veiled/VLS-VoxLiturgicalSpec.adoc`:\n- Core naming: Cipher, Signet, Epithet, Inscription, Vesture, Ensign, Monogram\n- Standard vestures: Rust, Bash, AsciiDoc, Publication, Git, Slash\n- Cipher registry reference\n- Terminal exclusivity rules\n- Minting discipline\n\n**BUS (Bash Utilities Specification)** — new file `Tools/buk/vov_veiled/BUS-BashUtilitiesSpec.adoc`:\n- Tabtarget Vesture (naming rules)\n- Tabtarget naming components: Colophon, Frontispiece, Imprint\n- Dispatch operations: Formulary, Launcher, Workbench, Testbench\n- Routing behavior\n\n**VOS changes:**\n- Remove Liturgy section (vosl_* terms)\n- Remove Dispatch section (vosd_* terms)\n- Add references to VLS and BUS\n- Keep VOS focused on kit release/install\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. Create VLS-VoxLiturgicalSpec.adoc with extracted Liturgy vocabulary\n2. Create BUS-BashUtilitiesSpec.adoc with Tabtarget Vesture + all Dispatch vocabulary\n3. Update VOS to remove extracted sections, add cross-references\n4. Update CLAUDE.md acronym mappings for new files\n5.

This is error-prone and easy to forget, leading to downstream paces with stale or incomplete specifications.\n\n**Proposed workflow:**\n- Define materials/artifacts produced by each pace (outputs field in tack)\n- At wrap time, surface remaining paces that might consume or be affected by these materials\n- Allow developer to review and update downstream pace specs before proceeding\n- Link materials to dependent paces for future reference\n\n**Design questions:**\n- Where does materials tracking live?

Follow the pattern established in `Tools/vvc/src/vvcc_commit.rs:196-249` where Rust spawns `claude --print --model haiku` as a subprocess.\n\n## Definition to Establish First\n\nBefore writing any code, document this routine definition in JJSA:\n\n**jjdr_session_probe** (Rust-autonomous routine):\n- Inputs: firemark\n- Behavior:\n  1. Query steeplechase for most recent `s` marker for this heat\n  2. If none found OR timestamp > 1 hour ago: probe needed\n  3. If probe needed:\n     a. Spawn `claude --print --model haiku` → capture model ID\n     b. Spawn `claude --print --model sonnet` → capture model ID  \n     c. Spawn `claude --print --model opus` → capture model ID\n     d. Collect hostname via `hostname` command\n     e. Collect platform via `uname -s` + `uname -m`\n     f. Create `s` marker via internal chalk creation (same transaction)\n  4. Return: probe was performed (true/false)\n- Key: ALL execution happens in Rust. Slash commands just read the output flag.\n\n## Files\n\n1. JJSA-GallopsData.adoc - Add jjdr_session_probe mapping and inline definition\n2. JJSCSD-saddle.adoc - Add Needs-session-probe output (Rust computes and sets this)\n3. JJSCPD-parade.adoc - Add Needs-session-probe output for heat mode\n\n## NOT in scope\n\n- Slash command modifications - they consume the flag, don't execute the probe\n- Separate JJSRSP file - routine is simple enough to define inline in JJSA\n\nAcceptance: jjdr_session_probe is clearly defined as Rust-autonomous following vvcc pattern.

The S/s distinction (Slate vs Session) is easy to miss. We want a registry pattern that catches collisions.\n\n## Design\n\nCreate a `jjrnm_MarkerRegistry` (marker module) with:\n\n1. **Code constants** — all marker chars defined in one place:\n   ```rust\n   pub const JJRNM_APPROACH: char = 'A';\n   pub const JJRNM_WRAP: char = 'W';\n   pub const JJRNM_SLATE: char = 'S';\n   pub const JJRNM_SESSION: char = 's';\n   // etc.\n   ```\n\n2. **Registration struct** — mini object that registers on construction:\n   ```rust\n   pub struct jjrnm_MarkerCode {\n       code: char,\n       name: &'static str,\n   }\n   \n   impl jjrnm_MarkerCode {\n       pub const fn new(code: char, name: &'static str) -> Self {\n           Self { code, name }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Static registry** — collects all codes, validates uniqueness:\n   ```rust\n   // Using inventory crate or lazy_static with a validation function\n   // Panics at init if any two codes collide\n   ```\n\n4. **Validation** — either:\n   - Runtime: `lazy_static` init that panics on collision\n   - Test: `#[test]` that iterates all markers and checks uniqueness\n   - Compile-time: const fn if feasible (preferred)\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. New file `jjrnm_markers.rs` with constants and registry\n2. Update `jjrn_notch.rs` to use constants from registry\n3. Test that validates no collisions exist\n4. Bonus: test that all codes are printable ASCII and case-distinct per category\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- All marker codes defined in one file\n- Collision between any two codes causes test failure or init panic\n- Existing functionality unchanged",

Sort files within a group by prefix for visual clustering of co-located files.\n\n### Properties\n\n- Worst case (every file unique pattern): degrades to one file per line — still compact\n- Best case (spec + impl + test move together): 3 files collapse to 1 row\n- Fixed-width bitmap column is scannable and diffable\n- Reads left-to-right: pattern → files\n\n## Data Source\n\nSteeplechase tack records contain basis SHAs. `git diff --name-only <sha1> <sha2>` between consecutive tack entries yields files per pace. Only completed paces with commits contribute rows.\n\n## Integration\n\n- Surface via `--files` flag on parade\n- Compute on demand from tack SHAs (no caching needed for typical heat sizes)\n- Paces with no commits yet are columns in the legend but will have no `x` marks\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- `jjx_parade <firemark> --files` outputs hybrid bitmap visualization\n- Bare filenames, grouped by touch pattern, sorted by prefix within groups\n- Pace legend uses coronet terminal letters",

This makes it hard to:\n- Assess blast radius of a heat's changes\n- Identify hotspot files touched by many paces (potential conflict zones)\n- Review whether a heat's scope has drifted from its paddock intent\n- Brief a new session on what areas of the codebase a heat has been working in\n\n## Proposed Feature\n\nSurface a file-touch summary in saddle and/or groom output. Data source: steeplechase commit history (already tracked via rein/notch).\n\n### Visualization Options\n\n**Per-file summary:**\n```\nFiles touched by ₣AG (5 paces, 12 commits):\n  Tools/jjk/vov_veiled/src/jjrg_gallops.rs  [₢AGAAA ₢AGAAF]  3 commits\n  Tools/jjk/vov_veiled/src/jjro_ops.rs       [₢AGAAE]          1 commit\n  Tools/jjk/vov_veiled/JJSA-GallopsData.adoc [₢AGAAC ₢AGAAF]  4 commits\n```\n\n**Per-pace file list:**\n```\n₢AGAAA express-pace-state:\n  jjrg_gallops.rs, jjrt_types.rs\n₢AGAAF json-schema-commit-to-basis:\n  jjrt_types.rs, jjrg_gallops.rs, JJSA-GallopsData.adoc\n```\n\n### Data Source\n\nSteeplechase tack records already contain `basis` (commit SHA). Between consecutive tack entries, `git diff --name-only <sha1> <sha2>` yields the files changed per pace. Alternatively, parse commit messages matching `jjb:HALLMARK:CORONET:` pattern from git log.\n\n## Design Questions\n\n- Which command(s) should surface this? saddle, groom, parade, or a new subcommand?\n- Should this be a flag (`--files`) or always shown?\n- How to handle paces with no commits yet (rough/bridled but unstarted)?\n- Performance: git log parsing for large heats — cache or compute on demand?\n- Depends on base-commit (₢AGAAI)? Could use heat base_commit as diff anchor, or work without it by using per-pace tack SHAs.\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- Design decision on where visualization lives and what format\n- If proceeding: implementation plan covering data extraction, formatting, and command integration",

But RBRR/RBRA/RBRP regime variables reference Google-specific types (`axtg_project_id`, `axtg_region`, `axtg_service_account`, etc.).\n\n## Question to resolve\nShould regime variables with Google types:\n- (A) Voice `axtg_*` directly — they're already specific enough\n- (B) Voice `rbst_*` subspecializations — e.g., `rbst_depot_project_id` voices `axtg_project_id`\n\n## Considerations\n- `axtg_*` types ARE already subspecializations of universal types\n- Adding `rbst_*` layer may be unnecessary indirection\n- BUT: `rbst_*` allows RB-specific constraints (naming conventions, validation rules)\n- Consistency with RBRV pattern vs pragmatic simplicity\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- Decision documented in ₣AS paddock\n- Pattern guidance for regime specs using Google types\n- Update RBAGS voicings if needed",
