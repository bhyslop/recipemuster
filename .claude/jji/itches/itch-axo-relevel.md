# Itch: Relevel AXL axo_ Category

The axo_ (Axial Operation) category has accumulated disparate concepts:

1. **Operation execution types** (original intent): command, guide, pattern, sequence
2. **Identity concepts**: role, identity, actor
3. **Configuration infrastructure**: regime, slot, assignment
4. **Dependencies**: dependency

## Proposed First Step
Sort all axo_ attribute mappings into coherent subgroups to understand the natural clustering before deciding on category splits.

## Options to Consider
- Keep axo_ as broad "operational infrastructure"
- Split identity concepts to new prefix (axi_ is taken for Interface)
- Move regime/slot to axr_ (structural parallel with record/member)
- New category for configuration concepts

## Context
Emerged during RBAGS AXL voicing heat, session 2025-12-23.
