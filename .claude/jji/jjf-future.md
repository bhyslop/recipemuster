# Job Jockey Future Itches

Ideas and potential efforts worth doing in the future.

- rbags-retriever-spec: Specify rbtgo_retriever_create and rbtgo_image_retrieve in RBAGS
- rbags-validation-run: End-to-end test of remote build with real infrastructure
- rbags-payor-spec-review: Verify rbtgo_payor_establish/refresh spec matches rbgm_ManualProcedures.sh
- rbags-api-audit: Verify remaining RBAGS operations against GCP REST API docs (depot_create, depot_destroy, retriever_create)
- rbgg-rename: Rename rbgg_Governor.sh to better reflect scope (handles all depot service accounts + project lifecycle, not just Governor role)
