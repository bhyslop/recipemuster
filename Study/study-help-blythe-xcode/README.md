## Install NPM and Node

From claude:
```
I'll provide you with the commands to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on macOS.
Here's the command line for installing Node.js and npm using Homebrew, which is the recommended method:
bash/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install node
This does two things:

Installs Homebrew (if you don't already have it)
Uses Homebrew to install Node.js (which includes npm)

If you already have Homebrew installed, you can simply run:
bashbrew install node
After installation, you can verify that both are properly installed by checking their versions:
bashnode -v
npm -v
Would you like me to explain these commands or provide alternative installation methods?
```

After homebrew install, last lines:

==> Next steps:
- Run these commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    echo >> /Users/bhyslop/.zprofile
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/bhyslop/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
