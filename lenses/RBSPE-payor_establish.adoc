The
{at_operator}
performs one-time manual setup via Google Cloud Console to establish
{rbtr_payor}
OAuth infrastructure.
No API path exists for initial bootstrap - OAuth client creation requires human Console interaction.
This procedure creates the project and OAuth client but does NOT install credentials.

. *Create Payor Project*:
.. Navigate to project creation in Console
.. Set project name: `Recipe Bottle Payor`
.. Set project ID: `rbw-payor` (preferred fixed name, single payor per account)
.. If `rbw-payor` already exists, use `rbw-payor-[4-digit-suffix]` (e.g., rbw-payor-2024)
.. {rbhg_store}
actual project ID as `«PAYOR_PROJECT_ID»` for subsequent operations
.. If Console displays "You need additional access" error after project creation, wait a few minutes and refresh the page.
GCP IAM changes are https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-change-propagation[eventually consistent] and may take time to propagate.

. *Configure Billing*:
.. Access billing management in Console
.. Select or create billing account
.. Record
{rbrp_billing_account_id}
(format: XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX)
.. Link billing account to payor project
.. {rbhg_require}
billing linkage for API operations

. *Enable Required APIs*:
.. Navigate to APIs & Services > Enable APIs
.. Enable: Cloud Resource Manager, Cloud Billing, Service Usage, IAM, Artifact Registry
.. These enable programmatic depot management

. *Configure OAuth Consent Screen*:
.. Navigate to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen
.. Click "Get started" to launch Project Configuration wizard
.. Complete 4-step wizard:
... Step 1 - App Information: Set app name and user support email
... Step 2 - Audience: Select "External" (testing mode, no verification required)
... Step 3 - Contact Information: Provide email for notifications
... Step 4 - Finish: Accept User Data Policy and create

. *Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID*:
.. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
.. Create credentials > OAuth client ID
.. Application type: Desktop app
.. Name: "Recipe Bottle Payor"
.. Click CREATE
.. Popup displays client ID and client secret
.. Download JSON (filename: `client_secret_[id].apps.googleusercontent.com.json`)
.. {rbhg_warn}
Client secret visible only in this popup; June 2025 onwards, Google will not display it after closing

// ⟦axs_outputs⟧

The outputs of payor establishment are:
- Project ID (`«PAYOR_PROJECT_ID»`) recorded from step 1
- OAuth client credentials: client ID and secret from the downloaded JSON file

// ⟦axs_completion⟧

NOTE: Payor establishment creates the OAuth client configuration but does not perform credential installation.
Proceed to
{rbtgo_payor_install}
to complete setup by installing and testing OAuth authentication.
