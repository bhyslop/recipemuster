{gcp_service}
via service account.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧

Path to an RBRA file stored in the operator's local filesystem outside the source repository.
This file enables the operator to assume the governor role for
{gcp_project_id}
administration operations.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_payor_rbra_file}

Path to an RBRA file stored in the operator's local filesystem outside the source repository.
This file enables the operator to assume the payor role for billing and
{gcp_project_id}
lifecycle operations.

// ⟦axhrgb_group⟧
{rbrr_group_container_runtime}

Variables that configure container runtime and deployment environment settings.
These settings control local Podman VM configuration, DNS resolution, and build machine selection.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_vessel_dir}

Directory path containing vessel configuration subdirectories.
Each subdirectory defines a vessel image source (bind or conjure mode).

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧

DNS server IP address used by sentry containers for name resolution.
Injected into container environment to control DNS behavior.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_ignite_machine_name}

Podman machine name for bottle ignition (startup) operations.
Identifies which Podman VM to use for local image building and testing.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_deploy_machine_name}

Podman machine name for bottle deployment operations.
Identifies which Podman VM to use for production deployments.

// ⟦axhrgb_group⟧
{rbrr_group_build_configuration}

Variables that control container image build processes.
These settings define build tooling, platform targets, timeout constraints, and machine resources for
{gcb_service}
operations.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_crane_tar_gz}

Path to crane tool tarball archive.
Crane is used for OCI image manipulation and registry operations.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_manifest_platforms}

Space-separated list of platforms for multi-platform manifest creation.
Example: `linux/amd64 linux/arm64`.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_chosen_podman_version}

Podman version string for VM provisioning and build operations.
Must match a valid Podman release version.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_chosen_vmimage_origin}

Podman VM image origin specification.
Determines which VM base image to use for machine creation.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_chosen_identity}

Identity specification for VM or build environment.
Used to configure authentication and authorization context.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_gcb_machine_type}

Google Cloud Build machine type specification.
Determines CPU, memory, and performance characteristics for build workers.
Examples: `E2_HIGHCPU_8`, `E2_HIGHCPU_32`.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_gcb_min_concurrent_builds}

Minimum number of concurrent Cloud Build executions required.
The nameplate audit and build preflight query the depot project's *Concurrent Build CPUs* quota via the Service Usage API and verify that `CPU_QUOTA ÷ vCPUs_per_build ≥` this value.
Hard-fails if quota headroom is insufficient.

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
{rbrr_gcb_timeout}

Maximum duration for Cloud Build operations before timeout.
Specified in seconds or duration format (e.g., `3600s`).

// ⟦axhrgv_variable⟧
