The {ops_rbv_check} verifies whether newer VM images are available upstream by comparing SHA digests. This operation uses a temporary {at_stash_machine} with crane installed to query registries without modifying configuration.

. Create Temporary {at_stash_machine}
* Initialize new Podman machine using name from {rbrr_stash_machine}
* Start the machine and install crane from {rbrr_crane_tar_gz}
* Verify crane installation completed successfully

. Query Upstream Image
* Use crane to query digest of {rbrr_chosen_vmimage_origin}:{rbrr_chosen_podman_version}
* Store the returned SHA digest for comparison
* Fail if query returns no valid digest

. Verify Custom FQIN (if applicable)
* If {rbrr_chosen_vmimage_fqin} differs from standard origin:version pattern:
** Query the FQIN directly using crane
** Compare FQIN digest against upstream digest
** Report any discrepancies as warnings

. Cleanup Resources
* Stop and remove the temporary {at_stash_machine}
* Ensure no orphaned resources remain

. Report Findings
* Display current {rbrr_chosen_vmimage_sha} value
* Display latest upstream SHA digest
* Indicate required actions:
** If SHA not set: request user to set {rbrr_chosen_vmimage_sha}
** If SHA differs: notify update available
** If SHA matches: confirm system is current
