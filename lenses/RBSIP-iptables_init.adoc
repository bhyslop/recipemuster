Establishes foundational security state:

. Base Chain Configuration:
* Flush all rules from filter and nat tables
* Set policy DROP on all base chains (INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT)
* Accept loopback interface traffic unconditionally via first rule in INPUT chain

. State Tracking Setup:
* Insert RELATED,ESTABLISHED tracking as second rule in chains:
** INPUT chain with "-m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT"
** FORWARD chain with same state match
** OUTPUT chain with same state match

. RBM Chain Creation:
* Create in filter table with default policy DROP:
** RBM-INGRESS for input control
** RBM-EGRESS for output control
** RBM-FORWARD for forwarding control
* Insert jumps as third rule in respective base chains:
** INPUT jumps to RBM-INGRESS
** OUTPUT jumps to RBM-EGRESS
** FORWARD jumps to RBM-FORWARD
