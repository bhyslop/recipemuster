NOTE: This operation orchestrates the precisely ordered sequence of steps needed to start a
{at_sentry_container}
that enforces network policy for a new
{at_bottle_service}.

// ⟦axs_behavior⟧
. *Create Network Infrastructure*:
.. {rbbc_call}
{mkr_network_create}
to establish
{at_transit_network}
and
{at_enclave_network}
.. {rbbc_require}
both networks created successfully

. *Launch Sentry*:
.. {rbbc_call}
{mkr_sentry_run}
to start
{at_sentry_container}
with required privileges and initial network configuration
.. {rbbc_require}
sentry container running

. *Connect Sentry to Enclave*:
.. {rbbc_call}
{mkr_network_connect}
to attach
{at_sentry_container}
to
{at_enclave_network}
with proper IP configuration
.. {rbbc_require}
sentry has connectivity on both networks

// ⟦axs_completion⟧
Successful execution establishes the
{at_sentry_container}
with dual network connectivity, ready to enforce network policy for the
{at_bottle_service}.
