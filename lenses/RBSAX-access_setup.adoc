If {rbrn_uplink_access_mode} is disabled, this sequence:

* Verifies DROP policy exists for all filter table chains
* Removes NAT rules except those marked "RBM-PORT-FORWARD"
* Adds explicit DROP rules for non-port traffic:
** RBM-EGRESS: DROP all eth0 output
** RBM-FORWARD: DROP all eth1 forward

If {rbrn_uplink_access_mode} is global or allowlist, this sequence:

. Network Interface Configuration:
* Enable IPv4 forwarding
* Disable IPv6
* Set rp_filter to strict mode (1) on all interfaces
* Set route_localnet on eth0

. NAT Configuration:
* Add POSTROUTING on eth0:
** Source from eth1 subnet
** MASQUERADE to eth0 IP
* Preserve rules marked "RBM-PORT-FORWARD"

. DNS Server Access:
* If {rbrr_dns_server} is configured:
** Add rule to RBM-EGRESS accepting traffic to {rbrr_dns_server}
** Add rule to RBM-FORWARD accepting traffic to {rbrr_dns_server}
* These rules are independent of {rbrn_uplink_access_mode} and {rbrn_uplink_allowed_cidrs}

. Filter Configuration:
* If {rbrn_uplink_access_mode} is global:
** Accept all output on eth0 in RBM-EGRESS
** Accept all forward from eth1 in RBM-FORWARD
* If {rbrn_uplink_access_mode} is allowlist:
** For each CIDR in {rbrn_uplink_allowed_cidrs}:
*** Accept in RBM-EGRESS matching destination
*** Accept in RBM-FORWARD matching destination
* Maintain existing port rules
