NOTE: This operation conjures an
{rbtga_ark}
in
{rbtgi_repository}
by building a container image from a vessel specification and assembling build provenance metadata. The
{rbtr_director}
performs the build via
{gcb_service}.

NOTE: This is the ark-level view of the build operation. For detailed build procedure steps, see
{rbtgo_trigger_build}.

The conjure operation:

// ⟦axs_inputs⟧
. *Validate Input Parameters*:
.. {rbbc_require}
vessel directory provided as first argument
.. {rbbc_require}
vessel contains conjuring configuration (RBRV_CONJURE_DOCKERFILE, RBRV_CONJURE_BLDCONTEXT)

// ⟦axs_behavior⟧
. *Execute Build*:
.. Delegate to
{rbtgo_trigger_build}
which:
... Verifies git repository is clean
... Packages build context from vessel
... Submits build to
{gcb_service}
... Waits for build completion
.. On success, both
{rbtga_ark_image}
and
{rbtga_ark_about}
artifacts are created with shared
{rbtga_consecration}

// ⟦axs_outputs⟧
. *Display Results*:
.. {rbbc_show}
vessel image built with consecration tag

// ⟦axs_completion⟧
Successful execution creates a complete
{rbtga_ark}
with both image and about artifacts sharing the same
{rbtga_consecration}.
