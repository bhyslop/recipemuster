== Overview

This Configuration Regime specifies variables that define container image vessel configurations within the Recipe Bottle system.
Each {rbrv_regime} represents a distinct container image definition with its own build parameters and runtime characteristics.
RBRV regimes are found in `rbev-vessels/*/rbrv.env` files and control the build process for specific container image types.

Vessels are either *binding* (use existing upstream image) or *conjuring* (build from Dockerfile).
The `RBRV_BIND_*` and `RBRV_CONJURE_*` variable groups are mutually exclusive.
