//axhrb_regime
{rbrv_regime}

This regime specifies variables that define container image vessel configurations within the Recipe Bottle system.
Each {rbrv_regime} instance represents a distinct container image definition with its own build parameters and runtime characteristics.
RBRV assignment files are found in `rbev-vessels/*/rbrv.env` and control the build process for specific container image types.

//axhrv_variable
{rbrv_sigil}

Unique identifier for the vessel type.
Must form valid directory name and moniker basis.

//axhrv_variable
{rbrv_description}

Human-readable documentation of the vessel's purpose, role, and key characteristics.
Used for identification in logs, messages, and documentation contexts.

//axhrv_variable
{rbrv_vessel_mode}

Selects which variable group is active for this vessel.

//axhrgb_group
{rbrv_group_binding}

//axhrgc_gate
{rbrv_vessel_mode} {rbrv_vessel_mode_bind}

Variables in this group apply only when {rbrv_vessel_mode} is {rbrv_vessel_mode_bind}.

//axhrgv_variable
{rbrv_bind_image}

Upstream container image reference used directly without modification.

//axhrgb_group
{rbrv_group_conjuring}

//axhrgc_gate
{rbrv_vessel_mode} {rbrv_vessel_mode_conjure}

Variables in this group apply only when {rbrv_vessel_mode} is {rbrv_vessel_mode_conjure}.

//axhrgv_variable
{rbrv_conjure_dockerfile}

Path to the Dockerfile used during the build process.
Typically `${RBRR_VESSEL_DIR}/${RBRV_SIGIL}/Dockerfile`.

//axhrgv_variable
{rbrv_conjure_bldcontext}

Build context directory passed to the container build engine.
Typically `${RBRR_VESSEL_DIR}/${RBRV_SIGIL}`.

//axhrgv_variable
{rbrv_conjure_platforms}

Target platform architectures for multi-platform builds.
Example: `linux/amd64 linux/arm64 linux/arm/v7`.

//axhrgv_variable
{rbrv_conjure_binfmt_policy}

QEMU binary format policy for multi-platform builds.
Controls cross-architecture binary format emulation during build.
