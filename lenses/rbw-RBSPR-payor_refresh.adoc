Manual procedure to install OAuth credentials for new setup or refresh expired/compromised credentials.
Use this for both initial credential installation after
{rbtgo_payor_establish}
and for renewal operations.

. *Obtain OAuth Credentials*:
.. For initial setup: Use JSON file downloaded during
{rbtgo_payor_establish}
.. For refresh/renewal: Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials in Payor Project
... Click existing "Recipe Bottle Payor" OAuth client to open details
... If secret compromised:
.... Click "+ Add secret"
.... Click download icon next to NEW secret
.... Browser downloads `client_secret_[id].apps.googleusercontent.com.json`
.... Click "Disable" on secret with older creation date
.... Click trash icon to delete that disabled secret

. *Install/Refresh Credentials*:
.. Run: `rbgp_payor_install ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json`
.. This will:
... Guide you through OAuth authorization flow
... Store secure credentials in `~/.rbw/rbro.env`
... Test the authentication
... Initialize depot tracking
... Update `RBRP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `rbrp.env`

. *Verify Installation*:
.. Test with: `rbgp_depot_list`
.. Should display current depots without authentication errors

NOTE: OAuth refresh tokens in testing mode expire after 6 months of non-use.
