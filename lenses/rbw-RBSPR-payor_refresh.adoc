Manual procedure to install OAuth credentials for new setup or refresh expired/compromised credentials.
Use this for both initial credential installation after
{rbtgo_payor_establish}
and for renewal operations.

. *Obtain OAuth Credentials*:
.. For initial setup: Use JSON file downloaded during
{rbtgo_payor_establish}
.. For refresh/renewal: Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials in Payor Project
... Find existing "Recipe Bottle Payor" OAuth client
... Download new JSON (or regenerate secret if compromised)
... Save as `payor-oauth-[timestamp].json`

. *Install/Refresh Credentials*:
.. Run: `rbgp_payor_install /path/to/payor-oauth.json`
.. This will:
... Guide you through OAuth authorization flow
... Store secure credentials in `~/.rbw/rbro.env`
... Test the authentication
... Initialize depot tracking
... Update `RBRP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `rbrp.env`

. *Verify Installation*:
.. Test with: `rbgp_depot_list`
.. Should display current depots without authentication errors

NOTE: The credential installation functionality is now handled by
{rbtgo_payor_refresh}
procedure.
OAuth refresh tokens in testing mode expire after 6 months of non-use.
