Validate staged content size against storage cost limits.
Prevents accidental commits of release tarballs, build artifacts,
node_modules, or large binaries.

The cost model approximates incremental storage impact:

* New file (A): blob size
* Modified text (M): diff size (delta compression)
* Modified binary (M): blob size (no delta)
* Deleted file (D): 0

{voss_inputs}

* `limit` — Maximum allowed size in bytes (standard: 50000)
* `warn` — Warning threshold in bytes (standard: 30000)

{voss_behavior}

. Get list of staged files via `git diff --cached --name-only`
. For each staged file:
.. Determine change status via `git diff --cached --name-status`
.. If deleted: size = 0
.. If added: size = blob size via `git cat-file -s`
.. If modified:
... Check if binary via `git diff --cached --numstat` (binary shows `-\t-\t<path>`)
... If binary: size = blob size
... If text: size = diff output size via `git diff --cached -- <path>`
. Sum all file sizes
. If total > `limit`: emit blocked message with breakdown, return 1
. If total > `warn`: emit warning message, return 2
. Otherwise: return 0

{voss_outputs}

* Exit 0: under limit (OK to commit)
* Exit 1: over limit (commit blocked)
* Exit 2: over warning threshold (commit allowed with warning)

{voss_completion}

Returns exit code indicating status.
On blocked (exit 1), emits breakdown of largest files to stderr.
