Acquire an exclusive lock for commit operations.
Uses `git update-ref` for atomic lock acquisition.
Returns an RAII guard that releases the lock when dropped.

The lock prevents concurrent commit operations from corrupting
repository state.
Lock reference: `refs/vvg/locks/vvx`.

None.

{voss_behavior}

. Get current HEAD commit SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD`
. If no HEAD (empty repo): use null SHA `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
. Attempt `git update-ref refs/vvg/locks/vvx <SHA> ""`
. If update-ref succeeds: lock acquired, return RAII guard
. If update-ref fails: another operation holds the lock, return error

{voss_outputs}

* On success: RAII lock guard (`vvcc_CommitLock`)
* On failure: error string "Another commit in progress - lock held"

{voss_completion}

Lock is held until the guard is dropped.
Drop implementation calls `git update-ref -d refs/vvg/locks/vvx` to release.

*Implementation:* `Tools/vvc/src/vvcc_commit.rs` — `vvcc_CommitLock::vvcc_acquire()`
