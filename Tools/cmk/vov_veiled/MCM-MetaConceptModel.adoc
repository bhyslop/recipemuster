== Core Structure

A
{mcm_concept_model}
creates a cohesive gestalt - a unified constellation of ideas whose relationships and interactions transcend their individual definitions.
Through carefully curated terminology and precise linking patterns, each
{mcm_concept_model}
illuminates the deep conceptual relationships that give meaning to a domain.

The power of a
{mcm_concept_model}
lies in its ability to:

* Reveal the natural connections between ideas
* Preserve the integrity of concept relationships through evolution
* Enable clear visualization of how changes to one concept ripple through the constellation
* Guide understanding through carefully mapped idea spaces

Each
{mcm_concept_model}
manifests through a
{mcm_document}
that follows strict organizational patterns.
These patterns ensure that as the constellation evolves, their relationships remain clear and traceable.

The
{mcm_document}
contains two primary constrained element types:

* A
{mcm_mapping_section}
that defines all
{mcm_linked_term_s}
* One or more
{mcm_definition_section_s}
that provide precise meaning for each term

Through these elements, the
{mcm_document}
maintains the delicate balance between rigorous structure and organic concept evolution, allowing the idea constellation to grow while preserving its essential relationships.

== Text Organization

Text within a
{mcm_document}
follows specific structural rules to enable clear tracking of changes and relationships.

=== Line Break Fundamentals

The most fundamental organizing principle is the
{mcm_line_break}
.
Each
{mcm_line_break}
creates a clear boundary in the
{mcm_document}
while preserving fluid rendering in the output document.

==== Basic Line Break Rules

{mcm_line_break_s}
occur in these precise patterns:

* Between independent sentences
* Before and after each
{mcm_linked_term}
(including each term within a sequence)
* Between fragments that surround
{mcm_linked_term_s}

Basic example showing sentence and term breaks:

[source,asciidoc]
----
The system initializes its components.
The
{excm_processor}
begins operation.
Each component reports its status.
----

==== Term Integration Patterns

When incorporating
{mcm_linked_term_s}
the text follows these specific patterns:

Single term integration - breaks before and after the term:

[source,asciidoc]
----
The system processes
{excm_request}
according to defined rules.
----

Multiple
{mcm_linked_term_s}
in sequence - each term gets its own line, with commas attached:

[source,asciidoc]
----
The interface supports
{excm_drag},
{excm_drop},
and
{excm_scroll}
operations.
----

Complex
{mcm_linked_term}
relationships - each standalone term gets breaks:

[source,asciidoc]
----
The
{excm_validator}
applies each
{excm_rule}
to ensure
{excm_compliance}
with system requirements.
----

These patterns apply consistently across all document contexts, including:

* Regular paragraphs
* List items
* Definition entries
* Section introductions

=== Paragraph Organization

Paragraphs in the
{mcm_document}
follow these structural principles:

* {mcm_blank_line_s}
appear only between true paragraphs
* No
{mcm_blank_line_s}
between sentences within a paragraph
* No
{mcm_blank_line_s}
around source code blocks or list items
* Each paragraph focuses on a single concept or relationship

Example paragraph structure:

[source,asciidoc]
----
The system initializes its core components.
Each component performs self-diagnostics.
The
{excm_validator}
confirms system health.

The initialization process then moves to external systems.
The
{excm_connector}
establishes required links.
Each connection undergoes verification.
----

=== Special Cases

==== List Items

The
{mcm_document}
presents list items
with proper term integration
and conceptual breaks:

[source,asciidoc]
----
* The first item spans
{excm_component}
boundaries
* A second item demonstrates
{excm_process}
flow
* The final item shows
{excm_result}
formatting
----

==== Definition Entries

Definition entries follow standard sentence breaks while maintaining definition list structure:

The single space following `::` is necessary.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[excm_term]]
{excm_example}:: 
The primary definition establishes core meaning.
Additional sentences expand understanding.
The
{excm_linked_term}
shows relationship handling.
----

==== Source Code Boundaries

Source code blocks establish strict boundaries for
{mcm_curation_action_s}.
These boundaries protect code content while maintaining proper term integration in surrounding text:

[source,asciidoc]
----
The
{excm_processor}
implements this interface:

[source,java]
-----
public interface Processor {
    void process();
    Status check();
}
-----

The implementation ensures
{excm_compliance}
with system requirements.
----

{mcm_curation_action_s}
respect these boundaries by:

* Maintaining term integration and line breaks in surrounding text
* Treating code block contents as opaque
* Preserving code formatting without modification
* Excluding code content from term matching and promotion analysis

This boundary pattern ensures code examples remain stable through document evolution while maintaining proper conceptual integration in their context.

=== Punctuation Rules

Punctuation follows standard English conventions regardless of line breaks:

* Sentence-ending punctuation stays with the sentence
* Commas remain with their preceding phrase
* Quotation marks enclose their content without breaks
* Parentheses maintain content unity

Example punctuation handling:

[source,asciidoc]
----
The system (version 2.0) activates its components.
The
{excm_processor}
begins its "primary sequence."
After initialization,
the system reports "ready."
----

=== Document Mechanics

=== {mcm_mapping_section} Constraints

The
{mcm_mapping_section}
enforces alignment rules to enhance readability and change tracking:

* The `<<` of each
{mcm_domain}
aligns to columns that are multiples of 10
* When entries require wider alignment, all lines adjust to the next larger multiple
* {mcm_attribute_reference_s}
maintain consistent indentation

[source,asciidoc]
----
// tag::mapping-example[]
:excm_doc_short:              <<excm_short,Short Term>>
:excm_doc_longer_term:        <<excm_longer,Longer Term>>
:excm_doc_much_longer_term:   <<excm_much_longer,Much Longer Term>>
// end::mapping-example[]
----

The
{mcm_mapping_scrub}
maintains these alignments during curation unless expansion is required.

=== Document Source Management

The
{mcm_document}
maintains compatibility with line-based tools
while preserving semantic structure.

This means:

* Favoring AsciiDoc's native list markers
over hardcoded sequence numbers

* Preserving processor directives
that enable clean rendering

* Ensuring changes remain visible
in both source differencing tools
and rendered comparisons

The goal is maintaining a document that:

* Shows ancestry clearly in source
* Renders cleanly through AsciiDoc
* Displays changes meaningfully in diffs
* Supports post-rendering analysis

=== Term Hierarchy Management

When
{mcm_linked_term_s}
appear to form hierarchical relationships, the
{mcm_document}
flattens this hierarchy through specific patterns:

* Each
{mcm_linked_term_s}
receives first-class presentation in the
{mcm_mapping_section}
* Related
{mcm_linked_term_s}
maintain separate definitions
* Relationships express through careful definition crafting

Example of hierarchical
{mcm_linked_term_s}
handling:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:excm_doc_validation:             <<excm_validation,Validation>>
:excm_doc_validation_rule:        <<excm_validation_rule,Validation Rule>>
:excm_doc_validation_set:         <<excm_validation_set,Validation Set>>
----

The definitions then express relationships:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[excm_validation]]
{excm_doc_validation}:: 
The process of applying rules to ensure content correctness.

[[excm_validation_rule]]
{excm_doc_validation_rule}:: 
A specific constraint within the {excm_doc_validation} framework.

[[excm_validation_set]]
{excm_doc_validation_set}:: 
A collection of {excm_doc_validation_rule_s} that work together.
----

== Definition Patterns

=== Definition Form Patterns

Each
{mcm_linked_term}
in a
{mcm_document}
requires an anchor target and a definition.
The form determines how these elements are structured.

[[mcm_annotation]]
{mcm_annotation}::
A comment line providing type categorization or metadata about terms in a
{mcm_document}.
{mcm_annotation_s}
are ignored during first-order document reading.
When a referencing system is in context,
{mcm_annotation_s}
provide structured metadata interpreted by that system.
The content contains space-separated
{mcm_linked_term_s}
from the referencing system, which is typically out-of-context during first-order reading.
The grammar, interpretation, and placement rules for
{mcm_annotation_s}
are defined by the referencing system, not MCM.
+
{mcm_annotation_s}
take one of two forms:
+
* *Strachey bracket form*: `// ⟦terms⟧` — a comment with space after `//` containing Strachey-bracketed content.
* *Prefix-discriminated form*: `//ax...` — no space after `//`, where the initial characters match a registered prefix identifying the referencing system.
The full content after `//` is interpreted by the referencing system.
+
The mechanical discriminator is the character immediately following `//`.
A space character indicates a regular comment or Strachey bracket form.
A letter with no intervening space indicates prefix-discriminated form.
+
Registered prefixes:
+
* `ax` — Axial Lexicon

[[mcm_form_deflist]]
{mcm_form_deflist}::
The standard pattern using AsciiDoc definition list syntax.
The anchor target appears on its own line, followed by an optional
{mcm_annotation}
then the term reference with `::` and definition text.
Use for standalone terms with self-contained meaning.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[term_anchor]]
// ⟦...⟧
{term_reference}::
Definition text following sentence-per-line rules.
----

[[mcm_form_bullet]]
{mcm_form_bullet}::
A pattern for terms that belong to a parent structure or sequence.
Each term appears as a bullet item under its parent section.
The anchor target appears after the bullet marker, followed by an optional
{mcm_annotation}
then the term reference with definition prose.
Use for fields of a structure or steps in a procedure.

[source,asciidoc]
----
* [[field_anchor]]
// ⟦...⟧
{field_reference} defines the specific meaning within the parent structure.
----

[[mcm_form_section]]
{mcm_form_section}::
A pattern where the section heading itself is the term.
The anchor target appears before the section marker, followed by an optional
{mcm_annotation}
then the section heading containing the term reference.
The section content constitutes the definition.
Use for terms whose meaning requires extended explanation or contains nested child terms.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[sequence_anchor]]
// ⟦...⟧
=== {sequence_reference}

The sequence executes these steps:

* [[step_one_anchor]]
// ⟦...⟧
First step description.
----

=== Definition Organization Patterns

The
{mcm_document}
supports three primary patterns for organizing
{mcm_definition_section_s}:

==== Traditional Grouped Definitions

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Core Terms

[[excm_term1]]
{excm_term_one}:: 
Primary definition establishing core meaning.
Subsequent sentences expand understanding, though this is at most one paragraph.

[[excm_term2]]
{excm_term_two}:: 
Related term definition showing relationships.
----

==== Distributed Definitions

Definitions may accompany relevant content sections:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== System Components

Here we explore key architectural elements.

[[excm_component]]
{excm_sys_component}:: 
Definition tied directly to its context.

The discussion continues...
----

==== Domain-Specific Glossaries

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Technical Terms

[[excm_tech1]]
{excm_tech_term_one}:: 
Technical definition with domain focus.

[[excm_tech2]]
{excm_tech_term_two}:: 
Related technical concept definition.
----

=== {mcm_category}, {mcm_variant}, and {mcm_domain} Usage

The
{mcm_category},
{mcm_variant},
and
{mcm_domain}
work together to maintain precise term relationships and variations.

==== {mcm_category} Rules

* Each
{mcm_category}
declares its scope in the
{mcm_mapping_section}
header
* {mcm_category_ies}
distinguish terms by conceptual role
* New
{mcm_category_ies}
require explicit declaration

Example
{mcm_category}
declarations:

[source,asciidoc]
----
// exn_: Noun concepts - entities and objects
// exv_: Verb concepts - actions and operations
----

==== Variant Patterns

Common
{mcm_variant_s}
follow consistent patterns:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:exn_word:                   <<excm_word,Word>>
:exn_word_s:                 <<excm_word,Words>>
:exn_word_p:                 <<excm_word,Word's>>
:exv_act:                    <<excm_act,Act>>
:exv_act_s:                  <<excm_act,Acts>>
:exv_act_ed:                 <<excm_act,Acted>>
:exv_act_ing:                <<excm_act,Acting>>
----

The
{mcm_mapping_scrub}
enforces consistent application of these patterns across the document.

==== {mcm_domain} Pattern

Each term definition establishes a unique anchor using snake case:

[source,asciidoc]
----
// Domain declaration: excm_<canonical_term>
----

== Task Lens Support

{mcm_concept_model_s}
support focused work contexts through
{mcm_task_lens_es}
that emphasize relevant concepts while suppressing distractions.
See the
{mcm_task_lens_guide}
for compilation specifications and usage patterns.

=== Task Lens Structure

Each
{mcm_task_lens}
follows this pattern:

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== [Task Lens Name]

**Purpose**: [One sentence describing the work this lens enables]

**Gestalt**: [Metaphorical description guiding term interpretation]

**Core Activation**:

* {linked_term} - [Aspect emphasis if needed]
* {linked_term} - [Aspect emphasis if needed]

**Expanded Activation**:

* {linked_term} - [Reduced detail focus]
* {linked_term} - [Reduced detail focus]

**Suppressed Activation**:

* List of {linked_term_s} to remain dormant
* Additional suppression patterns

**Critical Relationships**:

* {term_a} ↔ {term_b}: [What aspect matters]
* {term_c} → {term_d}: [Specific mechanism focus]
----

Multiple
{mcm_task_lens_es}
may share terms but apply different
{mcm_focal_depth_s}
and aspect emphasis based on their purpose.

=== Blank Line Exception for Task Lenses

Despite the general document rule against
{mcm_blank_line_s}
around list items,
{mcm_task_lens}
sections require specific blank lines for valid asciidoc parsing:

* One blank line after each `**Section**:` header before its list
* One blank line between major sections
* No blank lines between list items within a section

This exception exists because asciidoc requires blank lines before bulleted lists to parse correctly, and the structured nature of
{mcm_task_lens_es}
makes the blank line placement predictable and consistent.

== Actor Definitions

[[mcm_editor]]
{mcm_editor}::
The human originator of
{mcm_concept_model_s}
and constraints.
The
{mcm_editor}
guides document evolution, establishes patterns, and directs transformations while maintaining conceptual integrity.

[[mcm_digital_mind]]
{mcm_digital_mind}::
An agent, typically an LLM, transforming
{mcm_document_s}
under
{mcm_editor}
direction and document constraints.
The
{mcm_digital_mind}
performs well-defined
{mcm_curation_action_s}
while preserving document patterns and relationships.

== {mcm_curation_action_s}

[[mcm_curation_action]]
{mcm_curation_action}::
A process executed by a
{mcm_digital_mind}
to adjust a
{mcm_document}
as directed by the
{mcm_editor}.
Each
{mcm_curation_action}
has a specific focus and constraints, modifying only those aspects of the
{mcm_document}
that fall within its defined scope.

[[mcm_normalization]]
{mcm_normalization}::
A
{mcm_curation_action}
that brings a
{mcm_document}
to canonical form through two phases.

*Phase 1: Text Normalization*

Applies consistent formatting throughout the
{mcm_document}
body:

* One sentence per line
* Each
{mcm_linked_term}
on its own line
* Commas and punctuation attached to preceding element
* {mcm_blank_line_s}
only between paragraphs and definition entries
* Preserve source code block contents without modification

*Phase 2: Mapping Section Normalization*

Maintains strict structural integrity of the
{mcm_mapping_section}:

* Preserve
{mcm_category}
comment headers as
{mcm_category_group}
delimiters
* Within each
{mcm_category_group},
align `<<` to the smallest multiple of 10 columns that accommodates the longest
{mcm_attribute_reference}
* Maintain alphabetical ordering by display text within each
{mcm_category_group}
* One
{mcm_attribute_reference}
per line

[[mcm_category_group]]
{mcm_category_group}::
A contiguous block of
{mcm_attribute_reference_s}
in the
{mcm_mapping_section}
preceded by a category comment header.
Each
{mcm_category_group}
maintains independent column alignment,
allowing terms to be added without affecting other groups.

[[mcm_demotion_analysis]]
{mcm_demotion_analysis}::
A
{mcm_curation_action}
that identifies
{mcm_linked_term_s}
whose formal status may no longer justify their maintenance overhead.
It suggests candidates for demotion to
{mcm_fundamental_text}
based on criteria such as:
* Rare usage outside their own definition
* Lack of meaningful variation requiring
{mcm_attribute_reference_s}
* Minimal role in expressing relationships between other terms
* Terms whose precise meaning has become self-evident in context

[[mcm_link_validation]]
{mcm_link_validation}::
A
{mcm_curation_action}
that verifies the mechanical integrity of the
{mcm_document_p}
linking system without modification:

* Reports
{mcm_attribute_reference_s}
that lack corresponding anchors
* Reports anchors that lack corresponding
{mcm_attribute_reference_s}
* Validates
{mcm_domain}
format compliance
* Identifies malformed link syntax

This action produces a diagnostic report for
{mcm_editor}
review.
Repairs are performed manually or through targeted
{mcm_curation_action_s}.

[[mcm_promotion_analysis]]
{mcm_promotion_analysis}:: 
A
{mcm_curation_action}
that identifies frequently occurring or conceptually significant elements in
{mcm_fundamental_text}
that warrant promotion to
{mcm_linked_term}
status.
It suggests candidates based on:
* Frequency in definitions of other
{mcm_linked_term_s}
* Use in expressing core conceptual relationships
* Occurrence in multiple distinct contexts
* Words whose precise meaning needs maintenance across document evolution

[[mcm_term_matching]]
{mcm_term_matching}::
A
{mcm_curation_action}
that identifies instances where concepts corresponding to existing
{mcm_linked_term_s}
appear in text without proper linking:
* Identifies important terms that warrant linking
* Proposes what should be linked

[[mcm_validation_summary]]
{mcm_validation_summary}::
An advisory report produced by
{mcm_link_validation}
that documents the state of the
{mcm_document}
without making modifications.
The
{mcm_validation_summary}
enables the
{mcm_editor}
to identify issues requiring attention.

== Document Elements

[[mcm_fundamental_text]]
{mcm_fundamental_text}:: 
The basic sentences and phrases that comprise document text.
{mcm_fundamental_text}
follows specific formatting patterns in source while maintaining natural flow in rendered output.

[[mcm_notional_snippet]]
{mcm_notional_snippet}:: 
An exemplar that guides
{mcm_curation_action_s}.
While it may contain asciidoc noncompliance, the
{mcm_digital_mind}
uses it to understand patterns and generate compliant asciidoc output.

[[mcm_line_break]]
{mcm_line_break}::
A deliberate separation in a
{mcm_document}
that creates clear boundaries while preserving fluid rendering.
The
{mcm_line_break}
appears between independent sentences, before and after
{mcm_linked_term_s},
and between fragments surrounding
{mcm_linked_term_s}.
This pattern enables clean ancestry tracking while maintaining natural document flow.

[[mcm_blank_line]]
{mcm_blank_line}::
A purposeful demarcation in the
{mcm_document}
that separates major structural elements such as definition entries, sections, and lists.
The
{mcm_blank_line}
appears only between these elements, never within them.

== Term Management Elements

[[mcm_attribute_reference]]
{mcm_attribute_reference}::
A variable-style reference that connects a
{mcm_category}
prefixed attribute name to a specific
{mcm_domain}
and replacement text potentially with multiple
{mcm_variant_s}.
The
{mcm_attribute_reference}
forms the mechanical foundation for
{mcm_linked_term}
implementation in the
{mcm_document}.
Each
{mcm_attribute_reference}
follows strict formatting rules defined in the
{mcm_mapping_section}.


[[mcm_category]]
{mcm_category}::
A prefix mechanism that classifies
{mcm_linked_term_s}
by their conceptual role.
Each
{mcm_category}
must be declared in the
{mcm_mapping_section}
header and follows consistent patterns for classifying terms by type (e.g., 'doc_' for document elements, 'term_' for terminology elements).

[[mcm_variant]]
{mcm_variant}::
A systematic modification of a base term that maintains its core meaning while expressing a different form.
Common
{mcm_variant_s}
include plurals (_s), possessives (_p), and verb conjugations (_ed, _ing), each following patterns defined in the
{mcm_mapping_section}.

[[mcm_domain]]
{mcm_domain}::
A unique identifier that anchors a term's definition within the document structure.
Each
{mcm_domain}
uses snake case formatting and maintains consistent patterns (e.g., 'mcm_<canonical_term>') to enable reliable linking and reference.

[[mcm_task_lens]]
{mcm_task_lens}::
A focused activation pattern within a
{mcm_concept_model}
that emphasizes specific terms and relationships for particular work contexts.
Each
{mcm_task_lens}
defines which
{mcm_linked_term_s}
activate at what
{mcm_focal_depth}
and guides interpretation through gestalt descriptions and critical relationship specifications.


[[mcm_task_lens_guide]]
{mcm_task_lens_guide}::
A separate guide document that specifies how to compile task-focused representations from a full
{mcm_concept_model}.
The
{mcm_task_lens_guide}
defines lens structure patterns, compilation mechanics, and
{mcm_focal_depth}
activation rules for creating work-optimized views of concept constellations.

[[mcm_lens_specification]]
{mcm_lens_specification}::
The structured definition within a
{mcm_task_lens}
that categorizes
{mcm_linked_term_s}
by their
{mcm_focal_depth}
and provides aspect focusing guidance.
The
{mcm_lens_specification}
enables mechanical compilation of task-optimized representations from the full
{mcm_concept_model}.

[[mcm_focal_depth]]
{mcm_focal_depth}::
The activation level of a
{mcm_linked_term}
within a
{mcm_task_lens},
determining how much detail and relationship information to preserve.
The three
{mcm_focal_depth_s}
are Core (full detail with relationships), Expanded (supporting context), and Suppressed (explicitly dormant).
