Load and validate the
{jjdgr_gallops}
file.
Every operation that reads
{jjdgr_gallops}
invokes this routine.
Returns a validated
{jjdgr_gallops}
only after all checks pass.

{jjds_arguments}

// ⟦axd_required⟧
* {jjda_file}

{jjds_behavior}

. Read file contents as raw bytes
. Deserialize bytes into
{jjdgr_gallops}
structure
. Reserialize
{jjdgr_gallops}
structure to JSON string
. Compare reserialized bytes against original bytes
. If different:
{axc_fatal}
with diagnostic showing first difference location
. Validate semantic constraints (timestamps, kebab-case silks, invariants)
. If validation fails:
{axc_fatal}
with validation errors
. Return validated
{jjdgr_gallops}

{jjds_stdout} None (returns structure to caller)

{jjds_exit_uniform} 0 success, non-zero on validation failure or I/O error.

*Architectural constraint:*
{jjdr_load}
is the ONLY way to obtain a
{jjdgr_gallops}
from disk.
This makes validation bypass architecturally impossible.
The round-trip check (steps 3-5) ensures the file is in canonical form.
The semantic validation (steps 6-7) ensures business rules are satisfied.
