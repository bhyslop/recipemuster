Persist
{jjdgr_gallops}
to disk with validation.
Every operation that writes
{jjdgr_gallops}
invokes this routine.
Validates output by loading it back before finalizing.

{jjds_arguments}

// ⟦axd_required⟧
*
{jjdgr_gallops}
(in-memory structure to persist)

// ⟦axd_required⟧
* {jjda_file}

{jjds_behavior}

. Serialize
{jjdgr_gallops}
to canonical JSON string
. Write JSON to temporary file (atomic write preparation)
. Call
{jjdr_load}
on temporary file to validate what was written
. If
{jjdr_load}
fails: delete temporary file,
{axc_fatal}
with error
. Rename temporary file to final path (atomic commit)

{jjds_stdout} None

{jjds_exit_uniform} 0 success, non-zero on validation failure or I/O error.

*Design rationale:*
{jjdr_save}
reuses
{jjdr_load}
for validation, ensuring a single validation code path for both reading and writing.
If an operation produces invalid output, the save fails before corrupting the file.
