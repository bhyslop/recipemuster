## Job Jockey Configuration

Job Jockey (JJ) is installed for managing project initiatives.

**Concepts:**
- **Heat**: Bounded initiative with coherent goals that are clear and present (3-50 officia). Status: `racing` (active execution) or `stabled` (paused for planning). Location: `current/` or `retired/` (done).
- **Pace**: Discrete action within a heat.
- **Itch**: Future work (any detail level), lives in jji_itch.md. A **human reminder only** — never load-bearing. The operator reads it and decides whether it graduates to work; an agent must not cut paces or implement against itch content as if it were authority. Load-bearing guidance belongs where agents read it as authority — heat-shape in a paddock, durable facts in a spec — not in an itch (same posture as memos: a nudge, never authority).
- **Scar**: Closed work with lessons learned, lives in jjs_scar.md
- **Spook**: Team infrastructure stumble — any workflow failure improvable with deft attention. Capture as a pace when encountered, don't lose the current thread.
- **Cinch**: A decision settled in a paddock or docket and not to be re-litigated — both noun and verb ("cinch the approach," "the inscribe-skip is cinched"). Distinct from a *lock* in the concurrency sense (JJK's git-ref commit lock), which keeps that word.
- **Mulling heat**: A stabled heat paired with an aspirant sheaf — aspirancy is declared by the sheaf's `//axvd_sheaf axd_aspirant` voicing, never inferred from prose. Design leans bank in the sheaf (which outlives the heat); work-shape, dated cinches, and first-slating obligations bank in the paddock — read the paddock before cutting any pace. Sheaf-authoring paces may race on it; implementation paces wait for *settling* (dated cinches plus a held-for-discussion register drained into named settling paces), never for infusion — draining the sheaf is the execution's own work. Full doctrine: JJS0 "The Mulling Heat" (Aspirant Nucleations).

**Sincerity over efficiency:** When you notice something — a pattern, a concern, an insight about the work or the collaboration itself — say it. Discovery through conversation is part of the work, not a detour from it.

**Docket posture:** A docket is a specification of needed change, not architectural commentary. It articulates what done looks like — the completion criterion goes under a `## Done when` heading (never a bare `## Done`, which misreads as a record of work already finished) — and any cinched constraints, which go under a `## Cinched` heading (never `## Locked`: *lock* is reserved for the concurrency-sense git-ref commit lock); it points at sources rather than restating them. A short `## Character` line naming the cognitive posture (e.g., "intricate but mechanical," "design conversation requiring judgment") earns its keep; the rest of the docket should resist filling in.

**Slate-time vs mount-time.** The slate agent has just done analysis; the mount agent will reorient against the project as it stands then, with CLAUDE.md and specs already loaded. Hand off goal and boundary, not the analysis. Depth belongs in the slate commit message, not the docket body.

**Stale-by-mount filter.** Each line must still be true at mount-time. Fail (drift): line numbers, byte/match counts, version strings, exhaustive site enumerations. Pass (durable): file paths as entry points, commit hashes, spec/concept names.

**Docket anti-patterns:**
- Restating commits/specs the mount agent already loads. Point, don't paraphrase.
- Pre-baking implementation (function names, signatures, locations for new code). Mount-time decisions.
- Site enumerations. Write a discovery recipe (`grep "pattern" Tools/rbk/`) instead of listing six file:line entries.
- Body over ~15 lines warrants suspicion of overprescription.
- **Plan-step structure stays in the plan.** Docket phase/step labels (A/B/C, "Phase 1", "first/then/finally") must not appear as code comments — the plan won't exist at maintenance time, and line order already conveys execution.
- **Absolute paths to working trees.** Don't pin a docket to a specific repo clone (`/Users/foo/projects/your-project`, `~/proj/`). Mount may legitimately run against a different clone — if work needs to happen in *the* working directory, say so without naming it. Cross-repo coupling, if real, belongs in the paddock as a heat-shape note, not pace prose. Absolute paths *are* acceptable for external data roots (log dirs, `/tmp/...` scratch, machine-pinned data) — but flag those as operator-mutable rather than identity.

**Reference discipline.** Pace order is the dependency tree — single-operator workflow runs paces in heat order, so explicit dependency markers in docket prose are usually overspecified. Coronet cross-refs in dockets earn their keep only when the dependency crosses heats or skips order — rare, not never.

**Paddock posture.** A paddock articulates shape, cinched decisions, and what done looks like — not a progress journal. Git log and `jjx_log` are the journal; the paddock is the shape. **Coronets do not appear in paddock prose** — not retrospectively (annotating landed work, e.g., "BBAAM depot-identity-collapse"), not prospectively (naming planned paces, e.g., "AAF — Docker dual-daemon"), not as cross-references. A coronet is an enrollment-ledger key, not shape data; pace-state operations (drop, relabel, reorder, transfer) silently invalidate coronet refs while the prose keeps them. Refer to paces by purpose, not identifier; `jjx_show` is the authoritative source for what paces exist. Firemarks may appear (heats change rarely). When editing a paddock for other reasons, prune any coronet refs you find.

**Silks never appear in artifact prose.** Paddock and docket *prose* must never name heat silks — neither a heat's own silks nor another heat's. Silks are display names that evolve via `jjx_relabel`; the moment one drifts, the prose that quoted it is stale and quietly misleads. This is the same failure mode as the coronet-in-paddock rule above, applied to the third identity type, and it completes a three-way distinction by how each kind fares against the lifecycle:
- **Firemarks** — lifecycle-bound (a heat keeps its firemark for life) → fine in both paddock and docket prose.
- **Coronets** — stable but invalidated by pace-state ops (drop, relabel, reorder, transfer) → barred from paddock prose; in docket prose only for genuine cross-order or cross-heat dependencies (see **Reference discipline**).
- **Silks** — evolve freely via relabel → barred from *both* paddock and docket prose (this rule).

Refer to a heat or pace by its purpose, not its display name; the firemark — or, where dockets allow, the coronet — is the durable handle. When editing a paddock or docket for other reasons, prune any silks-shaped kebab strings you find, as you would a stray coronet.

**Semantic linefeeds in artifact prose.** Author paddock and docket prose — the bodies you write into `gazette_in.md` — with *semantic line breaks*: one sentence per line, and a long sentence broken at its major internal boundaries (em-dash, semicolon, colon, comma-before-conjunction). Markdown soft-wraps consecutive non-blank lines into one rendered paragraph, so this is invisible in the output and costs nothing; what it buys is the diff. Paddocks and dockets are edited incrementally and every edit is a commit, so one-thought-per-line makes a diff show the sentence that changed instead of re-flowing a 400-character paragraph as a single unreadable `+` line. Do not break at the word level — when you want word-grain diffs, that is `git diff --word-diff`, not physically split prose. (Instantiates JJS0's *Diff-Friendly Prose* principle, which governs gazette markdown only — not the `.adoc` specs, whose source answers to MCM line-break discipline.)

**Mid-execution posture.** When a failure or surprise surfaces while a pace is mounted, the default response is mechanism + one specific repair you'd attempt. Do not proliferate options or weigh consequences across alternatives — pace scope and segmentation are operator territory. If the repair is obvious, proceed; if not, surface the question and stop.

**Identities vs Display Names:**
- **Firemark**: Heat identity, two characters from a nonstandard b64 alphabet (e.g., `₣AA`, `₣Av`, `₣A-`, `₣A_`, `₣A7`). Used in command params and JSON keys.
- **Coronet**: Pace identity, firemark plus three characters from the same alphabet (e.g., `₢AAAAk`, `₢A-AAm`, `₢A_A-p`, `₢AAA_7`). Used in command params and JSON keys.
- **Silks**: kebab-case display name. Human-readable only — NOT usable for lookups.

When a command takes a firemark or coronet, provide the identity, not the silks.

**Display discipline (agent text output to user):**
- **Always show full coronets and firemarks; never abbreviate.** Write
  `₢A-AA-`, never `AA-`. Write `₣A-`, never `A-`. The operator works in
  several heats simultaneously; a bare 3-char pace suffix is ambiguous and
  forces re-derivation of the heat from context. The ₣/₢ glyph + heat half
  is part of the identity, not decoration. This holds in prose, tables,
  bullets, headers, and casual back-references.
- **Prefer coronets over silks in references.** Coronets are precise and
  immutable; silks change via `jjx_relabel`. Lead with the coronet; silks
  may follow parenthetically for human readability (e.g.,
  `₢A-AA- (wsg-trim-to-spec-shape)`). The coronet alone is always
  sufficient; the silks alone never are.

**Case sensitivity**: Firemarks and coronets are case-sensitive. `Av` ≠ `AV` ≠ `av`. Passing the wrong case produces a confusing "not found" error. Copy identities exactly as displayed — the final character's case distinguishes heats (e.g., `₣Av` vs `₣AV` are different heats).

- Target repo dir: `.`
- JJ Kit path: `Tools/jjk/README.md`

**MCP Tool Usage:**

All JJK commands are accessed via the single `mcp__vvx__jjx` MCP tool with four parameters:
- `command`: string selecting the operation — always the canonical `jjx_*` name (e.g., `"jjx_show"`, `"jjx_enroll"`, `"jjx_record"`)
- `params`: JSON object with command-specific fields (see reference below)
- `officium`: officium identity string from `jjx_open` (required on all commands except `jjx_open` — see Officium Protocol below)
- `model`: agent's verbatim model ID string from its system prompt (e.g., `"claude-opus-4-8"`). Required on ALL commands including `jjx_open`. The server gates commands by model tier under a three-bucket per-command policy — OPEN to every tier: `jjx_open` and the read commands (list, show, brief, coronets, log, search); DESIGNATION-GUARDED: orient, record, landing (see Bridle Protocol below); FRONTIER-ONLY (opus or fable): everything else — all docket-authoring and state-mutating verbs, close, validate, `jjx_apostille` itself, and the remote family.

**`params` must be a JSON object, never a string.** If params is accidentally stringified (e.g., `"{\"key\": \"val\"}"` instead of `{"key": "val"}`), deserialization will fail. The server has a defensive fallback for this, but always pass a native object.

**Verb names are NOT command names**: there is no `jjx_slate`, `jjx_mount`, `jjx_notch`, `jjx_groom` command. The verb table below maps horse vocabulary to actual MCP commands.
NEVER invent param fields — check the reference below first.

**Quick Verbs** — When user says just the verb, invoke the corresponding command:

| Verb | Noun | MCP command |
|------|------|-------------|
| muster | heats | `jjx_list` |
| parade | heat/pace | `jjx_show` |
| scout | heats | `jjx_search` |
| nominate | heat | `jjx_create` |
| mount | heat/pace | See Mount Protocol below |
| groom | heat | See Groom Protocol below |
| slate | pace | `jjx_enroll` |
| chivvy | pace | `jjx_enroll {first: true}` |
| cantle | pace | `jjx_enroll {after: <current_coronet>}` |
| reslate | pace | `jjx_redocket` |
| curry | paddock | `jjx_curry` (write; the read is `jjx_paddock`) |
| bridle | pace | `jjx_apostille {coronet, tier, effort?}` — see Bridle Protocol below |
| unbridle | pace | `jjx_apostille {coronet, release: true}` |
| notch | pace | See Commit Discipline below |
| wrap | pace | `jjx_close` |
| rail | heat | `jjx_reorder` |
| furlough | heat status/silks | `jjx_alter` |
| retire | heat | `jjx_archive` |
| restring | heat | `jjx_transfer` |
| foray | remote dispatch | See Foray Protocol below |
| unfurl | image | See Unfurl Protocol below |

**MCP Command Reference:**

All params are JSON objects. `?` = optional, `[]` = array. Booleans default to false.

```

**Key points:**
- **`jjx_orient` and `jjx_show` take their target(s) solely from `gazette_in.md` via `jjezs_halter` notices — never a param.** Write one body-less `# jjezs_halter <firemark|coronet>` notice per target (lede self-types by length: firemark -> heat expansion, coronet -> single pace), then call. A `firemark`/`targets` param is **rejected, not a fallback**; an absent gazette is a loud error. This forces your first gazette `Write` (and its permission prompt) to the start of the mount/groom ceremony, instead of stalling later at a slate.
  - `jjx_orient` (mount) — **exactly one** `jjezs_halter` notice; more than one is an error.
  - `jjx_show` (groom/parade) — **one or more** `jjezs_halter` notices (the heterogeneous set). No empty/auto-select path; you always name the target.
  - `remaining` (show) is **required** and stays a param — it is a display mode, not a target; it filters firemark expansion only (a directly-named coronet returns regardless of state). The tool-result is always the terse table; paddock(s) + pace dockets always land in `gazette_out.md` — Read it for the bodies. There is no `detail` param.
- `jjx_orient` output includes next actionable pace — no separate show call needed
- **`jjx_validate` is normalize-and-report, not a read-only check.** The verdict rides the exit code: **0 clean** (valid and already canonical; no write), **2 normalized** (valid but non-canonical — validate rewrote it to canonical form and committed, finalizing any in-progress merge), **1 broken** (parse or invariant failure; file untouched, never a silent fix). Residual: *normalized is a structural verdict, not a semantic blessing* — a `2` means the bytes are canonical, not that the heat/pace inventory is right. After a merge convergence, eyeball the inventory against both branches yourself.
- **Gazette output**: `jjx_orient`, `jjx_show`, and `jjx_paddock` write `gazette_out.md` with paddock and pace docket notices. Read the gazette file after these commands to get full content.
- **Never reach past the JJK interface to raw storage — NO exceptions.** Do not parse the harness's persisted tool-result files or the gallops JSON (`.claude/jjm/jjg_gallops.json`) directly. To read one pace's docket, call `jjx_brief {coronet}` (returns inline). To read full paddock/dockets after `jjx_show`/`jjx_orient`, read the `gazette_out.md` file directly. When a large `jjx_show` overflows the display and the harness persists the tool result, re-read `gazette_out.md` or loop `jjx_brief` per pace — never scrape the persisted blob. Same discipline as "never read regime files directly, go through the CLI."
- **Gazette input**: `jjx_enroll`, `jjx_redocket`, and `jjx_curry` read docket/content from `gazette_in.md`; `jjx_orient` and `jjx_show` read their target selection from `gazette_in.md` (`jjezs_halter` notices). Gazette is the sole input path — no JSON param fallback on any of them. An input notice's body must be **non-empty**: an empty or whitespace-only body rejects loud — a setter never executes a clear.
- **`jjx_paddock` reads, `jjx_curry` writes — mode is named by the command, never inferred.** `jjx_paddock` takes the firemark param and rejects loud if anything is staged in `gazette_in.md`; `jjx_curry` takes the staged `jjezs_paddock` notice (firemark in the lede) and no firemark param. The pair split because gazette-presence mode inference once let a pre-staged notice flip a read call into a silent, committed paddock wipe.
- `jjx_redocket` applies a **mixed single-heat batch**: any combination of one `# jjezs_paddock <firemark>`, multiple `# jjezs_reslate <coronet>`, and multiple `# jjezs_slate <silks>` notices in one `gazette_in.md`, applied as a single commit affiliated to the heat. Mass reslate (reslate-only) is the common special case. Constraints: **one heat only** — every reslate coronet's parent and the paddock firemark must name the same heat, else the batch is rejected (this same guard closed a latent cross-heat misattribution in the old reslate-only path); a slate-only batch has no heat anchor and is rejected (use `jjx_enroll`). Slate notices apply in **file order** (notice order = pace order); the `before`/`after`/`first` params position only the FIRST slate, the rest fold in after it; reslate and paddock never move the cursor.
- `jjx_curry` `note` param: optional short string appended to the paddock discussion commit message (e.g., `{"note": "updated after spook fix"}`)
- `jjx_close` takes `summary` as a string param (not stdin pipe)
- `jjx_close` takes `spook` as an optional string param — the wrap-time friction report (see Wrap Discipline). It rides the W chalk commit as a single-line `Spook:` trailer; absent or empty becomes `Spook: none`, so every wrap carries the line. Grep the corpus with `git log --all --format='%b' | grep '^Spook:'`
- `jjx_record` takes `files` as a native JSON array: `["file1.rs", "file2.rs"]`
- `jjx_transfer` takes `coronets` as a JSON-encoded string (not a native array): `"[\"AYAAA\", \"AYAAB\"]"`

### Officium Protocol

Each chat session must open an officium before using any jjx commands.

1. **At chat start**, call `jjx_open` (no params, no officium field). It returns a ☉-prefixed identity string (e.g., `☉260327-1000`), plus the absolute `gazette_in` / `gazette_out` paths for this officium — use those verbatim for gazette exchange (see Gazette paths below).
2. **On every subsequent jjx call**, pass the returned identity as the `officium` field on the MCP tool (sibling to `command` and `params`).
3. **Self-healing**: If any jjx command fails with "Officium directory not found", call `jjx_open` again to create a fresh officium, then retry.

**⚠️ `jjx_open` must land alone — never co-batch it with any call that consumes its result.** The officium ID is a server-minted opaque token; it cannot be guessed, predicted, or pattern-matched from a prior session. Issue `jjx_open`, read the returned ☉-id, and only *then* issue `jjx_show`/`jjx_orient`/`jjx_list`/etc. in a later tool block. Inventing a plausible-looking officium ID to fill a parallel batch is the classic self-inflicted "Officium directory not found" — the same trap applies to any "mint an ID → use the ID" pair (`jjx_create` → operate on the new firemark, `jjx_bind` → use the legatio token, `jjx_relay` → use the pensum token).

The ☉ (U+2609 SUN) prefix parallels ₣/₢ for firemarks/coronets. Pass it exactly as returned — the dispatcher strips it. **On disk the officium directory name has the ☉ stripped** (`.claude/jjm/officia/260327-1000/`, never `☉260327-1000`) — which is exactly why a gazette path is the server's to emit and yours to use verbatim, never to build by hand from the returned id (see Gazette paths below).

Gazette file exchange uses two directional files in the officium exchange directory. Every jjx MCP call unconditionally deletes both gazette files on entry (read+delete `gazette_in.md`, delete `gazette_out.md`). Gazette content has single-MCP-call lifetime — it is a parameter or a return value, not persistent state.

**⚠️ `gazette_in.md` is the argument to the *next* jjx call — whichever call that turns out to be.** It is not addressed to a particular command; whatever jjx command fires next consumes it on entry. So writing the gazette and making the call are one atomic act: decide the command, write its gazette as the immediate last step before *that* call, then call. If you reconsider which command to run after writing, the staged gazette is now the wrong input — rewrite or clear it first. Never reason "a stale `gazette_in` is harmless, it gets deleted on entry": **deleted-on-entry means read-on-entry** — the stale notice is consumed as this call's input *before* it is deleted. The stakes are not symmetric: at best the wrong command is loudly rejected, but a gazette *setter* writes and **auto-commits with no confirm gate**. Two mechanical guards blunt the worst of it — an empty-bodied input notice rejects loud (a setter never executes a clear), and the paddock read/write pair is split into `jjx_paddock`/`jjx_curry` so a staged notice can never flip a read into a write — but a stale *non-empty* notice consumed by a matching setter still overwrites live content and commits the loss. Keep every gazette write welded to the single call it was written for.

- **`gazette_in.md`** (agent → server): write before calling a setter command (`jjx_enroll`, `jjx_redocket`, `jjx_curry`) — and before the two read commands `jjx_orient` / `jjx_show`, which take their target selection from `jjezs_halter` notice(s) here.
- **`gazette_out.md`** (server → agent): written by getter commands, read after they return. The next jjx call of any kind deletes it.
  - `jjx_orient` → `# jjezs_paddock <firemark>` + paddock content, `# jjezs_pace <coronet>` + docket content (for next actionable pace)
  - `jjx_show` → `# jjezs_paddock <firemark>` (one per distinct heat in the target set) + paddock content, `# jjezs_pace <coronet>` + docket per resolved pace
  - `jjx_paddock` → `# jjezs_paddock <firemark>` + paddock content

**Gazette wire format (setter commands):**
Each notice is a `#`-header line with slug and lede, followed by content body. The lede is **exactly one whitespace-free token** (silks / coronet / firemark) — nothing follows it on the `#` line; the body goes on the lines beneath. This is uniform across every input slug: `jjezs_slate` takes silks, `jjezs_reslate` takes a coronet, `jjezs_paddock` takes a firemark, `jjezs_halter` takes a firemark or coronet (and is body-less — the lede is the whole notice), and in each case appending extra text to the lede folds it into the identity and fails validation. The body is **mandatory** for the content-bearing slugs (`jjezs_slate`, `jjezs_reslate`, `jjezs_paddock`): an empty or whitespace-only body rejects loud — a setter never executes a clear. Write `gazette_in.md`, then call the command.

**Critical: `#` (H1) in gazette_in.md is a wire format delimiter, NOT a markdown heading.** For single-notice commands (enroll, curry, orient), use exactly ONE `#` line. For mass reslate and multi-target show, each `# jjezs_reslate` / `# jjezs_halter` line starts a new notice. All markdown headings within body content must use `##` or deeper — a bare `#` line inside content will be parsed as a notice boundary.

Wrong (parsed as TWO notices, fails with `unknown slug 'Paddock:'`):
```
# jjezs_paddock ₣BO
# Paddock: rbk-11-mvp-tactical
body...
```

Right:
```
# jjezs_paddock ₣BO
## Paddock: rbk-11-mvp-tactical
body...
```

**On failure:** If a gazette setter command fails, `gazette_in.md` is already consumed (deleted on entry). You must re-write it from scratch before retrying — there is nothing to re-read.

| Command | Write to `gazette_in.md` | Then call with params |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `jjx_orient` | `# jjezs_halter <firemark\|coronet>` (exactly one, body-less) | `{}` (target is in gazette lede) |
| `jjx_show` | `# jjezs_halter <firemark\|coronet>` per target (one or more, body-less) | `{"remaining": true\|false}` |
| `jjx_enroll` | `# jjezs_slate <silks>` + docket body | `{"firemark": "XX", "before?": ..., "after?": ..., "first?": ...}` |
| `jjx_redocket` | `# jjezs_reslate <coronet>` + docket body | `{}` (coronet is in gazette lede) |
| `jjx_redocket` (mass) | Multiple `# jjezs_reslate <coronet>` notices, each with docket body | `{}` |
| `jjx_redocket` (batch) | Mixed `# jjezs_paddock <firemark>` + `# jjezs_reslate <coronet>` + `# jjezs_slate <silks>` notices, one heat | `{"before?": ..., "after?": ..., "first?": ...}` (position the first slate) |
| `jjx_curry` | `# jjezs_paddock <firemark>` + content body (non-empty) | `{"note?": "commit annotation"}` |

Gazette paths are **emitted by the server**: `jjx_open` and `jjx_orient` return the absolute `gazette_in` / `gazette_out` paths in their output. Use those exactly as given. They resolve to `.claude/jjm/officia/<id>/gazette_in.md` and `gazette_out.md`, where **`<id>` is the officium id with the ☉ prefix stripped** (the dispatcher strips it; on disk the directory is `260327-1000`, never `☉260327-1000`) — which is precisely why hand-substituting the returned ☉-id into that template lands you in a glyph-named sibling that does not exist. Take the emitted path; do not rebuild it.

**Use the emitted path — never reconstruct it from the id, and never `find` for the gazette file.** Gazette files have single-MCP-call lifetime (deleted on entry, written only by getters on success), so a filesystem search will usually find nothing or a stale file, and an empty search result then poisons any command built on it. The gazette-consuming commands (`jjx_enroll`, `jjx_redocket`, `jjx_curry`) name the exact path they checked in their not-found error, so a miss tells you where the server looked — reconcile your write target with that path rather than hunting the filesystem. If a getter command *failed*, no gazette was written — fix the command, don't search for the file.

**Read-modify-write workflow** (paddock editing):
1. Call `jjx_paddock {firemark}` → writes `gazette_out.md`
2. Rename `gazette_out.md` → `gazette_in.md`, edit content
3. Call `jjx_curry`

**Show → reslate round-trip** (batch docket editing — the show output *is* the reslate input, bridged):
`jjx_show` always populates `gazette_out.md` with the resolved set (paddock[s] + every pace docket); `jjx_redocket` consumes `gazette_in.md` as `jjezs_reslate` notices. A small bash bridge turns one into the other, so a batch of dockets can be pulled, edited in place, and replumbed in a single mass reslate — without a new verb.

1. **Pull**: write the target selection to `gazette_in.md` — one `# jjezs_halter ₣XX` notice (or several, a heterogeneous set) — then call `jjx_show {"remaining": true}` and read the emitted `gazette_out.md`. (Show consumes the halter `gazette_in` and writes `gazette_out`; the bridge below then turns that `gazette_out` back into a fresh `gazette_in`.)
2. **Bridge**: drop the `# jjezs_paddock …` notices (and their bodies) and rewrite each output-typed `# jjezs_pace <coronet>` header to the input-typed `# jjezs_reslate <coronet>`. The pace *bodies* are already valid reslate dockets — only the slug changes:
   ```
   # keep the pace notices, drop the paddocks, rename the slug
   awk '/^# jjezs_paddock /{skip=1;next} /^# jjezs_/{skip=0} !skip' gazette_out.md \
     | sed 's/^# jjezs_pace /# jjezs_reslate /' > gazette_in.md
   ```
3. **Edit**: apply the actual docket change to `gazette_in.md`. For a *transformable* edit — a uniform mechanical rewrite across many dockets — this is one more pass, e.g. the heading migrations this surface was born from (portable in-place form, no GNU/BSD `-i` divergence):
   ```
   sed -e 's/^## Locked$/## Cinched/' -e 's/^## Done$/## Done when/' \
     gazette_in.md > gazette_in.tmp && mv gazette_in.tmp gazette_in.md
   ```
4. **Replumb**: `jjx_redocket {}` — mass reslate consumes every `jjezs_reslate` notice in one call, echoing a per-coronet diff.

**When to reach for the bridge — the axis is *transformable vs. bespoke*:**
- **Transformable wins the bridge.** When the edit is the same mechanical shape across N dockets (rename a heading, retag a term, normalize a phrase), the show→sed→reslate round-trip does all N in one pass with a diff you can eyeball. This is its home.
- **Bespoke authors per-pace.** When each docket needs its own novel prose — a different rewrite per pace, judgment per docket — there is no transform to express; author each `# jjezs_reslate <coronet>` notice by hand (one `gazette_in.md`, single `jjx_redocket`). The bridge buys nothing there and the sed is just friction.

The round-trip is a *deliberate* bash bridge, not a permissive parser: nothing in jjx emits reslate-shaped output, and the type wall holds — `jjx_show` emits the output-typed `jjezs_pace`, and you rewrite it to `jjezs_reslate` on purpose. There is no reslate dry-run; trust the per-coronet diff `jjx_redocket` echoes.

### Parallel Tool Batch Discipline

When several tool calls share one parallel block and one of them exits non-zero, the harness **cancels the still-queued siblings** ("Cancelled: parallel tool call … errored"). A screenful of cancellations therefore almost always traces to *one* real error upstream — diagnose that single failure, don't react to the cascade. Two rules keep jjx work out of this trap:

- **Never co-batch a producer with its consumer.** A command and another that needs its output, its minted id, or a path built from it must be sequenced across tool blocks, not issued together. (`jjx_open` is the canonical case — see the Officium Protocol barrier above.) This includes batching a state-mutating command like `jjx_record` alongside the edits or checks that are supposed to *precede* it: verify the tree first, commit second.
- **Keep fragile or dependent commands out of wide read-only batches.** An empty/failed sibling can silently cancel unrelated reads, which then reads as a far bigger failure than it is.

### Mount Protocol

When user says "mount" or you need to engage the next pace:

1. Resolve the target, then write it before calling: put exactly one `# jjezs_halter <firemark|coronet>` notice in `gazette_in.md`, then run `jjx_orient {}`. **A target is required** — `jjx_orient` takes no firemark param; the selection comes solely from the halter notice (a param target is rejected, an absent gazette is a loud error). If the user says "mount" without specifying a heat and you have no prior heat context in this session, ask which heat to mount rather than guessing; if you have prior context (previously mounted/groomed heat), use that firemark as the halter lede. Writing the notice first is the point — your first gazette `Write` (and its permission prompt) fires now, while the operator is present, instead of stalling a later slate.
2. Parse output: Racing-heats table, Heat/Next/Docket/Recent-work sections. Read paddock and pace docket from the gazette file written to the officium exchange directory.
3. **Read the paddock before the docket.** The paddock tells you the shape of the work and what's been learned; the docket tells you what to do next. Orientation before action.
4. **Lead with the pace goal in one sentence**, distilled from the docket — what this pace is trying to accomplish, stated precisely. Paces can sit weeks between slating and mounting; the operator needs goal recall first, not heat scenery. Then display brief heat context (silks + paddock one-liner + recent work) and finally the full docket.
5. **Name assessment**: If pace silks doesn't fit docket, offer rename via `jjx_relabel`
6. Propose the approach compactly — a one-line recommended execution strategy (model tier + sequential/parallel), not a multi-part briefing. Offer the reasoning (tier rationale, parallelization analysis) on request, not unprompted. Tiers: haiku (mechanical), sonnet (standard dev), opus (architectural).
7. Ask to proceed, then begin work

### Groom Protocol

When user says "groom":

1. Write the target selection to `gazette_in.md` — one `# jjezs_halter <firemark>` notice (or several for a heterogeneous groom) — then run `jjx_show {remaining: true}` (paddock + remaining dockets land in `gazette_out.md`). `jjx_show` takes no `targets` param; selection comes solely from the halter notice(s), and an absent gazette is a loud error.
2. Read `gazette_out.md` directly for full paddock and pace docket content — never the persisted tool-result blob or `jjg_gallops.json` (see "Never reach past the JJK interface" under Key points)
3. Display overview: heat silks, progress, remaining paces with dockets (from gazette)
4. Enter planning mode: suggest structural operations (slate new paces, rail to reorder, reslate to refine dockets, paddock review)

### Bridle Protocol

Bridling designates a pace for execution at a specific model tier: a frontier
agent records that it judged the pace mechanically defined, and the server
enforces the designation from there. The evaluator is always the calling
frontier agent, never the server. States: a `rough` pace is undesignated
judgment work; a `bridled` pace is designated, carrying its tier (and
optionally an effort word) until it is released, reverted, or closed.

**Bridling (frontier session designates):**

1. Read the candidate pace's docket via `jjx_brief` (and the paddock via
   `jjx_paddock` if heat context is needed for the judgment).
2. Judge it: mechanically defined means no ambiguities and no lurking
   design-level decisions. If the docket has gaps, REFUSE to designate and
   report the gaps to the operator — a gap is a reslate need, not a lower-tier
   problem.

   Tier is set by where judgment lives during execution, never by how much
   the pace matters. Operator presence LOWERS the tier requirement: the
   scarce resource a higher tier substitutes for is judgment, and an
   operator-present pace has judgment on tap in the room — the designee's
   job collapses to careful execution, accurate observation, clear
   surfacing. Stakes (destructive acts, real credentials) hold no tier
   either: stop-and-surface already forbids the improvisation stakes fear,
   and the person to surface to is present. What genuinely holds a frontier
   tier is plausible wrongness the operator cannot cheaply check — work
   that authors authority downstream work will obey (a ceremony document,
   a spec narrative), where an error reads fine and propagates.
3. Before designating a frontier tier, weigh mechanization: if the judgment
   the docket defers could be settled NOW — from the paddock's cinches, landed
   specs, and what this session already holds — propose the reslate that bakes
   those decisions into the docket, leaving a residue a lower tier can run.
   The proposal goes to the operator (a reslate is a work-content change,
   never applied silently); on approval, redocket, then bridle the mechanized
   pace. Judgment only the work itself can surface — spec authoring, gates,
   verification — is not mechanizable: designate it at its tier rather than
   manufacture a reslate.
4. Otherwise designate: `jjx_apostille {coronet, tier}` with the execution tier
   (haiku | sonnet | opus | fable), adding `effort` (low | medium | high |
   xhigh | max — Anthropic's effort words) only where the docket's depth is
   judged. Only a rough pace may be bridled.

**Designee session (the designated-tier agent executes):**

1. `jjx_orient` on the heat — resolution lands on the bridled pace, and the
   orient guard admits the session only if its tier matches the designation
   exactly (both directions: a frontier session is refused on a
   sub-frontier-bridled pace; a sub-frontier session is refused on rough).
2. Work the docket. Commit via `jjx_record` against the bridled coronet
   (firemark-affiliated record stays frontier-only for sub-frontier sessions).
3. Finish with `jjx_landing {coronet, agent, content}` — the completion report.
4. NEVER wrap: `jjx_close` is frontier-only, always. A frontier session
   reviews the landed work and wraps.
5. On any hole or surprise: stop and surface it — docket-authoring verbs are
   frontier-only, so a designee cannot restate its own orders.

**Escalation paths (designation is void when its judgment inputs change):**

- Edit-revert: any redocket of a bridled pace (single or mass reslate), and
  any transfer or relocate, automatically reverts it to rough and wipes the
  tier and effort. Relabel and reorder revert nothing.
- Deliberate release: `jjx_apostille {coronet, release: true}` returns the pace
  to rough judgment work (then optionally re-designate).
- Tier and effort persist through close as provenance of the executing session.

### Foray Protocol

When user says "foray" or asks to run something on a remote machine:

**Concepts:**
- **Legatio**: A standing SSH session to a remote project (fundus). Created by `jjx_bind`, identified by a token (L0, L1, ...). Persists for the officium lifetime.
- **Pensum**: An async dispatched job within a legatio. Created by `jjx_relay`, identified by a `₱`-prefixed token. Each pensum maps to a remote temp directory on the fundus.
- **Curia**: The invoking side (where Claude runs). **Fundus**: The executing side (where the tabtarget runs).

**Fundus constants** (use these for `jjx_bind`): the default reldir and BURN alias are project-specific — get them from your project's veiled `claude-jjk-*.md` (if present) or the target's BUK Regime Node profile.

**Workflow:**

1. **Bind** (once per session per host): `jjx_bind` with `{alias: "<BURN_ALIAS>", reldir: "<your-project-reldir>"}`. Resolves the BURN profile on the curia to extract host/user/command, then probes via SSH. Returns legatio token.
2. **Ensure curia is clean and pushed**: notch if needed, `git push` if needed. `jjx_relay` will refuse dispatch if working tree is dirty or HEAD is unpushed.
3. **Plant**: `jjx_plant` with `{legatio: "L0", commit: "<HEAD SHA>"}`. Resets fundus to exact commit.
4. **Relay**: `jjx_relay` with `{legatio: "L0", tabtarget: "<filename>.sh", timeout: <seconds>, firemark: "<heat>"}`. Returns pensum token.
5. **Check**: `jjx_check` with `{pensum: "<token>", timeout: 0}` for instant probe, or `timeout: <seconds>` to poll until terminal. Returns BURX fields + liveness report. On terminal status, also returns file list from remote temp dir.
6. **Fetch** (selective): `jjx_fetch` with `{legatio: "L0", path: "<absolute-path>"}` to retrieve specific result files. Use paths from the check file list.

**Liveness states** (from `jjx_check`):
- **running**: BURX_EXIT_STATUS absent, PID alive
- **orphaned**: BURX_EXIT_STATUS absent, PID dead (crashed without writing status)
- **stopped**: BURX_EXIT_STATUS present (check exit code)
- **lost**: burx.env file missing

**`jjx_send`** is for synchronous one-off commands (no pensum, no polling). Use when the command is short and you need inline results.

**Windows fundus body discipline:** When the fundus is a Windows host, both `jjx_send` and `jjx_relay`-dispatched tabtargets traverse the cmd.exe → wsl.exe / cygwin / PowerShell transport stack. Body authoring rules (escape `\$name` for w-letter wsl.exe transit, no heredocs, single-line `;`-joined for cmd.exe transit, lazy-flush avoidance for PowerShell cmdlets, etc.) live in your project's Windows scripting guide, if present. Empirical record under `Memos/memo-YYYYMMDD-windows-transport-{topic}.md`.

### Unfurl Protocol

When the user says "unfurl" (put an image on the diagram viewer), invoke the **`vvx_render`** MCP tool — `mcp__vvx__vvx_render`, a sibling of the gallops dispatcher, NOT a `jjx_*` command. It takes no officium and no model.

Params:
- `light` (required) — path to the image to display (SVG or raster).
- `dark` (optional) — path to a dark variant. When supplied it is **transported as the pair's second payload**; the viewer holds both and the operator toggles with `d`/`l`. The viewer never derives one from the other, so pass both paths when you have a light/dark pair (e.g. rbm's README `<picture>` SVGs). Omit it for a single-variant image.
- `anew` (optional boolean) — **you set this from conversational intent**, per the heuristic below.

**The `anew` heuristic** (the judgment you legitimately hold — decide alike every time so the surface is consistent):
- `anew: true` — a fresh look (fit-to-window). Use when the image is **new or different** from what is up, or the user explicitly asks for a fresh/refit view.
- `anew: false` — an iteration at the viewer's **held zoom + pan**. Use when the user is **tweaking the same image already on the viewer** (a re-render after an edit). Retaining the viewport is the point: the operator stays zoomed where they were looking.
- When unsure, omit it — the tool defaults to a fresh look (fit-to-window).

The push is **best-effort / fail-soft**: an absent or unreachable viewer comes back as a soft notice (not an error). Bringing the viewer up is paneboard's job (it conducts the window), so on a soft-fail, relay the notice — do not retry in a loop.

### Commit Discipline

When working on a heat, use `jjx_record` for commits with heat/pace affiliation.

**Pace-affiliated commit** (active pace provides context):
Use `jjx_record` with `{identity: "CORONET", files: ["file1", "file2"], intent: "description"}`

**Heat-affiliated commit** (no active pace, but part of heat work):
Use `jjx_record` with `{identity: "FIREMARK", files: ["file1", "file2"], intent: "description"}`

Synthesize intent from the conversation — describe *what* was accomplished, not *how*.

**Size guard — ALL commands accepting `size_limit?` (record, close, archive, curry, enroll, redocket, transfer)**: If ANY jjx command fails due to size limits, STOP. Report the byte count, limit, and per-file breakdown to the user, then WAIT for the user's review. The guard is a byte-sanity review step — its purpose is catching unintended bulk (e.g., a binary that snuck in), not gating decomposition. The default is uniform 50KB across all seven commands. Expected outcome: the user confirms the bytes are legitimate and directs you to raise the limit. Do NOT offer splitting as a parallel option — splitting enters the picture only if the user explicitly raises it, because the work genuinely decomposes. NEVER auto-override `size_limit`.

When user says "notch", determine context (pace or heat affiliated) and invoke `jjx_record` with the appropriate identity and explicit file list.

**Multi-Officium Discipline:**
Multiple Claude officia (concurrent chat sessions, each with its own ☉-prefixed officium ID) may work concurrently in the same repo. The explicit file list in `jjx_record` enables orthogonal commits.

- Claude is **additive only** — make commits, never discard changes
- "Unexpected" uncommitted changes are likely another officium's work
- If something looks wrong, ASK — do not "fix" by discarding
- Commit only YOUR files; ignore everything else

**Forbidden Git Commands — NO exceptions, NO "safe" variants:**
- `git reset` — ALL forms: `--hard`, `--soft`, `--mixed`, with paths, without paths. Even `git reset HEAD <file>` (unstaging) is forbidden — it's too close to destructive variants and Claude will reason its way into worse forms.
- `git restore` — ALL forms: working tree, staged, with `--source`, without
- `git checkout <file>` — when used to discard changes (navigating branches is fine)
- `git clean` — ALL forms
- `git stash` — ALL forms

**What to do instead:**
- Staging wrong? Run `jjx_record` with the correct file list — it handles staging
- Made a mistake? Make a new commit that fixes it — additive, not destructive
- Confused by repo state? ASK the user — another officium may be mid-work
- Need to undo something? Explain the situation to the user and let them decide

**JJX Commands Are Self-Committing:**
`jjx_enroll`, `jjx_close`, `jjx_record`, and other state-mutating jjx commands create git commits internally. **`jjx_close` (wrap) commits ALL uncommitted changes** — code files and gallops state together in one commit. Do NOT follow `jjx_record` or `jjx_close` with another commit command, and do NOT notch immediately before or after a wrap — the tree will already be clean. If a commit command says "Nothing to commit", check `git status --short` and accept the result. (For intermediate milestones, notch *during* work; whatever remains is captured by the wrap.)

**Diagnose Before Escalating:**
When a command fails, check the simplest explanation first. "Invalid params" means wrong field names — check the MCP Command Reference above, don't guess. One diagnostic command beats three speculative retries.

### Wrap Discipline

**NEVER auto-wrap a pace.** Always ask the user explicitly: "Ready to wrap ₢XXXXX?" and wait for confirmation before running `jjx_close`. The user decides when work is complete, not the agent.

When work is complete, report outcomes and ask. Do not wrap.

When wrapping (after user confirms), always include a summary of the work:
Use `jjx_close` with `{coronet: "CORONET", summary: "Added bitmap displays to orient output"}`

**Always answer the spook (friction) question at wrap.** Alongside `summary`, pass `spook` — a short, grep-friendly report of friction *you* hit during this chat: re-reads forced by a missing pointer, a docket aimed at a renamed file, a confusing paddock, a verb that fought you. Ask yourself "what snagged?" assuming something did, not "did anything snag?" — at wrap the pull is to tidy up and under-report, and that bias is the failure mode this channel exists to resist. Report only first-person in-chat events you observed (actionable), never a counterfactual claim that some affordance *helped* (an ablation you cannot run). "Nothing snagged" is a first-class answer: pass `spook: "none"` (or omit it) — required to answer, never required to invent. The reports accrete into a git-resident corpus (`Spook:` trailers) for later JJK affordance tuning; each line is a flag to verify against its own transcript, not authoritative data.
Use `jjx_close` with `{coronet: "CORONET", summary: "...", spook: "docket pointed at rbf_Foundry.sh but it was decomposed; cost two greps to relocate"}`
The agent always has context about what was accomplished — include it.

**Wrap is unscoped — known JJK bug, do NOT "fix" it.** Unlike `notch`/`jjx_record` (explicit file list), `jjx_close` (wrap) stages and commits **every** dirty file in the tree — your code, the gallops state, and anything another officium left uncommitted. Wrap is not yet as file-specific as notch; that gap is a known bug, deferred pending the planned git-worktrees switch — do not attempt to repair it. For now: before wrapping, make sure the tree holds only your work, or expect wrap to sweep all of it into one commit.
