// ⟦axhrb_regime⟧
{burd_regime}

This regime specifies the ephemeral runtime state assembled by bud_dispatch.sh during tabtarget execution.
Unlike file-sourced regimes, BURD variables are constructed inline during dispatch — no assignment file exists.
Variables arrive via three phases: input (caller-set), computed (derived during setup), and parsed (extracted from tabtarget filename).

// ⟦axhrgb_group⟧
{burd_group_input}

Variables set by the caller before dispatch invocation.
These configure dispatch behavior (verbosity, logging, interactivity) and identify the regime and coordinator to use.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_verbose}

Verbosity level controlling diagnostic output.
0=silent, 1=show messages, 2=enable bash trace (set -x).
Defaults to 0 if unset.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_regime_file}

Path to the BURC regime assignment file to source during setup.
Provides project-level configuration for tabtarget infrastructure.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_no_log}

When non-empty, suppresses all log file creation and output.
Used for lightweight dispatch where logging overhead is unwanted.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_interactive}

When non-empty, enables interactive mode: output goes to terminal via tee rather than curated log pipeline.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_color}

Color output policy.
Input as auto/0/1; resolved to 0 or 1 during dispatch.
Respects NO_COLOR environment convention.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_coordinator_script}

Path to the coordinator script (workbench/testbench) that handles the dispatched command.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_launcher}

Path to the launcher bootstrap script, set by the tabtarget before exec.
Identifies which launcher mediates between the tabtarget and the dispatch system.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_station_file}

Absolute path to the developer's station regime assignment file.
Set by the launcher from BURC_STATION_FILE, resolved to an absolute path.
Used by workbenches as a guard to ensure proper launcher invocation.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_term_cols}

Terminal column width at dispatch time.
Detected from stty if available, defaults to 80.
Used by presentation regime for output formatting.

// ⟦axhrgb_group⟧
{burd_group_computed}

Variables derived during dispatch setup by zbud_setup and zbud_process_args.
These provide temporal identity, filesystem paths for ephemeral artifacts, and execution context.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_now_stamp}

Unique timestamp combining date, time, PID, and random component.
Provides temporal identity for the dispatch invocation.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_temp_dir}

Ephemeral directory created for this dispatch invocation.
Removed after execution; contains working artifacts.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_output_dir}

Fixed output directory cleared and recreated on each dispatch.
Contains command results accessible after execution.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_transcript}

Path to the transcript file within the temporary directory.
Records execution trace.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_git_context}

Git describe output capturing repository state at dispatch time.
Recorded in logs for traceability.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_log_last}

Path to the "last" log file, overwritten each dispatch.
Quick access to most recent execution output.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_log_same}

Path to the "same" log file for the command+target combination.
Curated (colors stripped, temp paths normalized, VOLATILE lines removed).

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_log_hist}

Path to the timestamped historical log file for the command+target combination.
Includes timestamps on each line.

// ⟦axhrgb_group⟧
{burd_group_parsed}

Variables extracted from the tabtarget filename during argument processing.
The tabtarget inscription is split on the configured delimiter into positional tokens.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_command}

Primary command token (first token from tabtarget split).
Legacy alias equivalent to BURD_TOKEN_1.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_target}

Complete tabtarget string as received by dispatch.
Preserved for logging and diagnostics.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_cli_args}

Array of additional CLI arguments passed after the tabtarget.
Forwarded to the coordinator command.

// ⟦axhrv_variable⟧
{burd_token_1}
{burd_token_2}
{burd_token_3}
{burd_token_4}
{burd_token_5}

Positional tokens 1-5 from tabtarget filename split.
Token 1 is the colophon, token 2 is the frontispiece, token 3 is the imprint (if present).
Tokens default to empty string if not present in the inscription.

// ⟦axhro_kindle⟧
{bukro_kindle}

Inline initialization within zbud_main: zbud_setup sources the regime file, derives computed variables, creates ephemeral directories.
zbud_process_args parses the tabtarget and sets parsed variables.
No separate kindle function — the dispatch main IS the kindle.

// ⟦axhro_validate⟧
{bukro_validate}

Unexpected BURD_ variable detection via compgen scan after all variables are set.
Dies on any variable not in the known set.
Sentinel (zburd_sentinel) allows downstream code to assert dispatch is properly initialized.
