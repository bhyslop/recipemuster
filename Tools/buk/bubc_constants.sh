# it exports BURD_CONFIG_DIR (absolute), and we derive the basename here so
# tooling (qualify, tabtarget creation) refers to it without re-literaling.

# Precision exit-code band — deliberate-rejection gate codes.
# An in-band exit status means a named rejection gate fired on purpose;
# exit 1 stays "imprecise death" (buc_die default). buc_die propagates
# in-band $? values unchanged (the band membrane), so existing
# `cmd || buc_die` chains carry these codes to the dispatch boundary where
# the test orchestrator asserts them in negative cases.
# Placement: clear of shell-reserved codes (2, 126, 127, 128+n signals),
# the sysexits.h range (64-78), curl's exit codes (1-92), and
# timeout(1)/container-runtime reserved codes (124-125).
# Allocation rule: one code per rejection GATE, never per validation rule.
# Gates may share a code only if they never co-occur in one test case's
# spawn path — share across alternatives, never along a pipeline.
# No band code is minted outside this block.

# Gate codes, allocated upward from base. The regime-load pipeline crosses
# two gates in one spawn path — the buv layer (vet value checks + scope
# sentinel) and the regime module's own custom enforce rules — so per the
# allocation rule they carry distinct codes:
BUBC_band_regime=100    # regime-module custom enforce rejection (cross-field, format regex, existence)
BUBC_band_enroll=101    # buv enrollment-validation rejection (buv_vet, buv_scope_sentinel)
BUBC_band_recipe=102    # recipe validation rejection
BUBC_band_hygiene=103   # Dockerfile FROM-line hygiene rejection (rbfh)
BUBC_band_credless=104  # credless guard at token mint (fast-tier suite invariant)
# Self-test probe pins the band top, proving full-width propagation:
BUBC_band_selftest=115  # BUK self-test deliberate rejection (buw-xb fixture)

# Regime-poison tweak (BUS0 Tweak Mechanism; buost_ is BUK's reserved buo
# segment). The seam is one membrane in buv_regime_enroll — the single buv
# entry every regime kindle crosses, post-source pre-validate. Under this
# tweak name, BURE_TWEAK_VALUE names one variable to corrupt: "VAR=value"
# sets, bare "VAR" unsets. The seam applies only when VAR carries the
# enrolling scope's prefix, so a poison rides inert through the host
# regimes of a dispatch and lands exactly once, on its target.
BUBC_tweak_regime_poison="buost_regime_poison"

# Windows registry preconditions for unattended power-on posture.
# Operator-handbook step (BUSJHW Windows: Host Availability) sets these;
# bujb_invigilate_windows reads them. Single source of truth so the path
# the handbook tells the operator to set is the path invigilate queries.
# PowerShell-canonical form (HKLM:\ prefix, mixed case — registry is
# case-insensitive at the OS level so display case is purely cosmetic).
