## Bash Utility Kit (BUK) Concepts

BUK provides tabtarget/launcher infrastructure for bash-based tooling.

### TabTarget System

TabTargets are lightweight shell scripts in `tt/` that serve as the CLI entry point for all operations. They delegate to workbenches via launchers — no business logic lives in tabtargets.

**Discoverability**: `ls tt/` shows all available commands. Tab completion narrows by prefix: `tt/rbw-<TAB>`.

**Naming pattern**: `{colophon}.{frontispiece}[.{imprint}].sh`

| Part | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Colophon** | Routing identifier (includes hyphen, workbench matches on this) | `rbw-cr`, `buw-tt-ll` |
| **Frontispiece** | Human-readable description (PascalCase) | `Rack` |
| **Imprint** | Optional target parameter (nameplate moniker, fixture name, etc.) | `tadmor` |

- The `.` is the delimiter between parts
- The hyphen is part of the colophon (not a separator)

Example: `tt/rbw-cr.Rack.tadmor.sh` — colophon `rbw-cr` routes to the crucible rack command, frontispiece tells you what it does, imprint `tadmor` selects the nameplate.

Multiple tabtargets can share the same colophon but differ by imprint:
```
tt/rbw-cC.Charge.tadmor.sh
tt/rbw-cC.Charge.srjcl.sh
tt/rbw-cC.Charge.pluml.sh
```

### BUK Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Zipper** | BCG-compliant module kindling colophon→module→command array constants |
| **Workbench** | Routes commands: `{prefix}w_workbench.sh` |
| **Testbench** | Routes tests: `{prefix}t_testbench.sh` |
| **Folio** | Runtime target value (`BUZ_FOLIO`) passed to a command — nameplate moniker, role name, etc. How it arrives depends on the channel |
| **Channel** | Enrollment-time declaration of how a colophon receives its folio: `imprint` (from filename — one tabtarget per target), `param1` (command-line argument — single tabtarget), or empty (no folio needed) |

**Key files:**
- `Tools/buk/buc_command.sh` — command utilities
- `Tools/buk/bud_dispatch.sh` — dispatch utilities
- `Tools/buk/buw_workbench.sh` — workbench

## Forbidden Shell Operations

**Never use `cd` in Bash commands — NO exceptions.**

The working directory persists between Bash tool calls. A single `cd` corrupts ALL subsequent commands that use relative paths, including every `./tt/` tabtarget.

- Use absolute paths instead of cd'ing

**There is no safe cd.** Do not reason that "I'll cd back" — the next tool call may be yours or another Claude Code session's, and it will break.

## TabTarget Invocation Discipline

**Never wrap tabtarget invocations with `tee`, `tail`, `head`, `grep`, `2>&1`, or any other pipe — NO exceptions.**

Tabtargets self-log to `../logs-buk/`:
- `last.txt` — most recent invocation across all tabtargets
- `same-{cmd}.txt` — most recent invocation of this specific tabtarget
- `hist-{cmd}-{timestamp}.txt` — historical invocations

Both stdout and stderr are captured. Adding your own `tee` or `2>&1` duplicates work the tool already did. The real hazard is piping a tabtarget into `tail`/`head`/`grep`: zsh defaults `pipefail` OFF, so the pipeline returns the last command's exit status — usually 0. **A failing test reports as success.**

- Run the tabtarget directly, then read from `../logs-buk/` in a separate command
- Environment variables before the command are fine: `BURE_CONFIRM=skip ./tt/foo.sh`
- If you genuinely must pipe live output (rare — usually you can read the log instead), set `-o pipefail` on the same line, or check `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` (bash) / `${pipestatus[1]}` (zsh)

```
# Wrong — exit code is from `tail`, not the tabtarget; failures masked
./tt/rbw-tP.QualifyPristine.sh 2>&1 | tee /tmp/log | tail -80

# Wrong — even a bare `| head` discards the real signal
./tt/rbtd-s.TestSuite.fast.sh | head -50

# Right — separate commands; exit code preserved
./tt/rbw-tP.QualifyPristine.sh
tail -80 ../logs-buk/last.txt
```

**There is no safe `tee | tail`.** Do not reason "I'll just truncate the output for readability" — the truncation and the exit-code-eating are inseparable. Truncate by reading the log file afterward.

## Test Execution Discipline

Run test fixture tabtargets **sequentially, never in parallel**. Test fixtures share regime state and container/network namespaces — parallel execution causes resource conflicts and false failures.

```
# Correct: run one at a time
tt/rbw-tf.TestFixture.regime-validation.sh
tt/rbw-tf.TestFixture.tadmor-security.sh

# Wrong: never run fixtures concurrently
tt/rbw-tf.TestFixture.regime-validation.sh & tt/rbw-tf.TestFixture.tadmor-security.sh &
```
