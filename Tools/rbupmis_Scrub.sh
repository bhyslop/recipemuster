# Podman Machine Init Scrubber
#
#  This project builds confidence that the default podman VM image
#  retrieved by podman is the same as the one selected by this project
#  as determined from other means.  This script here removes the
#  accidental aspects so that we can compare the big sha that is
#  displayed to tag the VM version in use precisely.

# Reference stdout from podman machine init, below:
#
# Looking up Podman Machine image at quay.io/podman/machine-os-wsl:5.5 to create VM

# Importing operating system into WSL (this may take a few minutes on a new WSL install)...
# The operation completed successfully.
